<p>The Prime Minister has announced that the UK will be entering a new national lockdown from tomorrow (6th January). This means that all schools and colleges in England must close until at least mid-February half term. Please find below the full statement from the PM:</p>
<p>"Good afternoon,</p>
<p>I have today made an order under section 4(1) of the Coronavirus Act 2020 which requires me to announce a national lockdown for England.</p>
<p>From tomorrow (6th January), all schools and colleges in England must close until at least mid-February half term. This means that students will not be able to return to their education settings after tomorrow, except for specific circumstances such as obtaining urgent medical or dental care or accessing remote learning support.</p>
<p>This is a tough decision but I have taken this action because the number of cases of coronavirus remains too high and it is important that we all play our part in controlling the spread of the virus. It is crucial that we follow the rules and regulations to keep each other safe.</p>
<p>I know how difficult this will be for families, particularly those with children at school or college. I want to assure everyone that we are doing everything possible to support them during this time. We have provided guidance on what parents and carers can do to help their children access remote learning while schools and colleges are closed.</p>
<p>The government is also providing additional funding for education providers to support them in implementing measures to keep pupils safe, such as improving ventilation and providing personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>
<p>I know that this will be a challenging time for everyone but please remember that we are all in this together and it is important that we follow the rules and regulations to help keep each other safe. Thank you."</p>
