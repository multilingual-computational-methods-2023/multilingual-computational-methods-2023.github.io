            <p>2019-2020 flu season starts early, CDC says</p>
<p>The 2019-2020 flu season has started early and is expected to be more severe than usual, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We are already seeing some activity this year," Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters during a teleconference. "It's too early to say whether it will be a severe season like last year."</p>
<p>The 2019-2020 flu season typically starts in October or November but has been earlier this year due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. The virus has disrupted normal activities and travel, making it difficult for people to get together and spread the flu.</p>
<p>Last year's flu season was one of the most severe in recent years, with more than 80,000 deaths reported from January through May. The CDC is urging people to get vaccinated now to protect themselves and others against the virus.</p>
