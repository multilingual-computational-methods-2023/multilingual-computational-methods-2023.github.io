            <p>100,000 people in the UK have had their personal data stolen by hackers</p>
<p>By Rob Thubron on November 29, 2017 in News</p>
<p>The cyber attack was carried out by a group of hackers who are believed to be based in Russia.</p>
<p>Around 100,000 people in the UK have had their personal data stolen by hackers, according to reports. The attack was carried out by a group of hackers who are believed to be based in Russia.</p>
<p>The information that was stolen includes names, addresses, dates of birth, and social security numbers, as well as other sensitive details. It is not yet clear what the hackers intended to do with this data, but it could potentially be used for identity theft or fraud.</p>
<p>The attack comes just weeks after a major cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee in the US, which led to the leak of thousands of emails and revealed how political campaigns are vulnerable to hacking.</p>
<p>In response to the attack, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre has advised people to be vigilant for any suspicious activity and to report it to the authorities if they suspect their data has been compromised.</p>
<p>The news comes as a reminder that cyber attacks can have serious consequences for individuals and businesses alike. It is essential to stay up-to-date with the latest security measures and to educate employees on how to protect themselves online.</p>
