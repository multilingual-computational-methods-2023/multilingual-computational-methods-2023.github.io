<p>The new report from the World Health Organization (WHO) has revealed that the number of people worldwide who have been diagnosed with cancer is increasing, and this trend is expected to continue. The report also highlights the significant disparities in cancer incidence and mortality rates across different regions of the world.</p>
<p>According to the report, there were an estimated 9.6 million deaths from cancer globally in 2018, which represents a 39% increase since 1990. The highest number of cancer cases and deaths are observed in Europe, followed by North America and then Asia.</p>
<p>The report also highlights that the most common types of cancer worldwide are breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma. However, it is important to note that these numbers may be underestimated as many people do not seek medical attention or may not have access to healthcare services.</p>
<p>In addition to the rising number of cases, the report also highlights the disparities in cancer incidence and mortality rates across different regions of the world. For example, countries in sub-Saharan Africa have the lowest cancer incidence and mortality rates globally, while North America has the highest.</p>
<p>The report emphasizes the need for action to reduce the global burden of cancer by improving early detection and treatment, increasing access to healthcare services, and reducing the harmful use of tobacco and alcohol. It also calls for more research into new treatments and prevention strategies.</p>
