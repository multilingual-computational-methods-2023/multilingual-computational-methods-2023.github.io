            <p>2019-2020 flu season has started, according to CDC</p>
<p>By CNN Staff | January 6, 2020</p>
<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the 2019-2020 flu season has begun. The agency said in a statement that flu activity is currently high across the country, with more than half of all states reporting widespread influenza activity. "This means that many people are experiencing symptoms like fever, cough, and sore throat," the CDC said. "It's important to get your flu vaccine every year to protect yourself and those around you from serious complications." The agency recommends getting a flu shot as soon as possible, especially for people who live with or care for vulnerable individuals such as young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.</p>
