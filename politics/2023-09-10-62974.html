<p>Breaking News: 2019-07-15T14:38:26+02:00</p>
<p>The South African government has declared a national state of disaster in response to the outbreak of measles. The declaration was made by Health Minister Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi on Tuesday, July 16th, 2019. The state of disaster will allow for the quick and effective implementation of measures to control the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that measles is a highly contagious viral infection that can cause serious complications such as pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death in severe cases. The organization estimates that over 100,000 people have died from measles since it was declared eliminated in 2015.</p>
<p>The government has announced a number of measures to combat the outbreak including increasing vaccination campaigns, improving access to healthcare services, and implementing measures to prevent the spread of the disease such as travel restrictions and quarantine procedures. The declaration also allows for the suspension of activities that may disrupt vaccination efforts or impede the movement of people and goods across borders.</p>
<p>The government has also warned that it will take legal action against anyone who spreads false information about the vaccine, which can hinder efforts to control the spread of measles.</p>
