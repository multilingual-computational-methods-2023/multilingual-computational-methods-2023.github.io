<p>New study shows that a third of all new jobs in the UK are in London and the South East.</p>
<p>A new report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has revealed that London and the South East are home to a third of all new jobs created in the UK, with the highest levels of employment growth seen in these regions. The ONS data also shows that the number of people aged 16-24 who are not in education, employment or training (NEET) has increased by 8.5% over the past year, with London having the largest increase at 9%. This is a concern as it suggests that more young people may be struggling to find work despite the high levels of employment seen in these regions. The report also highlights that the East Midlands and the West Midlands have experienced the lowest levels of job growth, with just 13% and 20% respectively.</p>
