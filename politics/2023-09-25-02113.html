<p>By The Caribbean Camera Inc. on July 5, 2019 Comments Off on Budget 2019-2020: What's in it for you?</p>
<p>The government of Prime Minister Andrew Holness has presented the country’s budget for the 2019-2020 fiscal year. Here are some key points from the budget speech delivered by Finance Minister Audley Shaw on June 30, 2019:</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of what you might get out of this budget:</p>
<p>1. Tax relief: The government will provide tax relief for individuals and businesses through lower taxes, reduced withholding taxes, and an increase in the threshold for income tax. This could mean that you could save more money on your income tax bill.</p>
<p>2. Education: The government has allocated $4 billion towards education, which includes funding for scholarships, teacher training, and upgrading of infrastructure. This could benefit students who are pursuing higher studies or looking to improve their skills.</p>
<p>3. Health: The budget allocates $817 million towards the health sector, including funding for medical equipment, hospital repairs, and mental health services. This could mean better healthcare facilities and improved access to quality medical care for patients.</p>
<p>4. Infrastructure development: The government has allocated $2 billion towards infrastructure development, which includes roads, bridges, water projects, and airport expansion. This could benefit those who rely on these infrastructure projects for their daily lives, such as commuters or farmers.</p>
<p>5. Social welfare: The budget allocates $10 billion towards social welfare programs, including cash transfers to the elderly, disability support, and funding for community development projects. This could mean better access to essential services for vulnerable groups in society.</p>
<p>6. Economic growth: The government has allocated $2 billion towards economic growth initiatives, which includes investment in industries such as agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing. This could benefit businesses looking to expand or invest in new areas of the economy.</p>
<p>7. Debt reduction: The budget provides a framework for reducing the country’s debt burden by investing in infrastructure projects and other economic development activities. This could mean that you might see some positive changes in the country’s financial situation over time.</p>
<p>Overall, this budget aims to improve the lives of Jamaicans through investments in education, healthcare, infrastructure, social welfare, and economic growth initiatives. However, it is important to note that these allocations are subject to appropriation by Parliament and may change based on the outcome of the 2019 general elections.</p>
