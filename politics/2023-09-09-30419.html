<p>The new study, published in the journal Nature Communications, shows that the number of people who have been exposed to the virus has increased by more than 8 million since the last report. The researchers used data from the World Health Organization and other sources to estimate the total number of infections worldwide, including those who have recovered or died.</p>
<p>The study is significant because it provides a more accurate picture of the true scale of the outbreak, which could help inform public health policies and efforts to develop treatments and vaccines.</p>
<p>The researchers found that the highest numbers of cases were in China, followed by Italy and South Korea. They also identified several regions where the virus has been spreading rapidly, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>The study highlights the need for continued global action to control the outbreak, including improving public health measures such as social distancing and contact tracing, developing effective treatments and vaccines, and increasing testing and surveillance efforts.</p>
