<p>Breaking News: The United States and China have reached a trade deal that will see the two countries reduce their trade deficit by $200 billion over the next two years.

As part of the agreement, China has agreed to purchase an additional $36 billion worth of goods and services from the United States over the next two years, while the US will reduce its trade deficit by $120 billion. The deal also includes commitments to intellectual property rights and technology transfer.
