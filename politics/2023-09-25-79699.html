<p>A new study has found that a common type of bacteria found in the gut could help to reduce inflammation and improve heart health. The study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, suggests that the bacterium called Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis may be able to reduce inflammation in the body by increasing levels of a protein called soluble mediator.</p>
<p>The researchers found that when they gave mice with high cholesterol and inflammation-causing genes a drink containing Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, their levels of soluble mediators decreased, indicating reduced inflammation. They also found that the bacteria was able to survive in the harsh environment of the mouse gut for several weeks, suggesting it may have potential as a probiotic therapy for heart health.</p>
<p>The study is significant because it shows that a beneficial bacteria can help to reduce inflammation and improve heart health, which could lead to new treatments for conditions such as high cholesterol and heart disease.</p>
