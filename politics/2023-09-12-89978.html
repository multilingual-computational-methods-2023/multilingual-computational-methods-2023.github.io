<p>The first-ever meeting of the Global Network for Negative Externality Research (GENER) was held in Vancouver, Canada from July 11 to 13, 2019. The conference brought together over 50 researchers and experts from various fields such as environmental science, economics, political science, sociology, and psychology to discuss the negative externalities of human activities on natural resources, ecosystems, and social well-being.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was graced by the presence of the Honorable Dr. Jane Philpott, former Minister of Indigenous Services Canada, who delivered a keynote address highlighting the importance of addressing negative externalities in sustainable development practices. The conference also featured a panel discussion on the role of governments in managing negative externalities, as well as a workshop on measuring and valuing ecosystem services.</p>
<p>The GENER network aims to promote collaboration among researchers and stakeholders to identify, assess, and mitigate negative externalities, with the goal of promoting sustainable development practices that benefit both people and nature. The conference provided an opportunity for participants to share their research findings, exchange ideas, and develop strategies for addressing negative externalities in various contexts.</p>
<p>The organizers would like to express gratitude to all the speakers, attendees, and sponsors who made this event possible. We look forward to future GENER conferences and continuing our efforts towards promoting sustainable development practices that benefit people and nature.</p>
