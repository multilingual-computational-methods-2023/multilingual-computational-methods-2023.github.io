<p>The US House of Representatives has voted to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time. The vote was 232-197, with one Democrat voting against and no Republicans voting in favor. This comes after the House Judiciary Committee approved two articles of impeachment earlier this week. If the Senate votes to convict Trump, he will be removed from office.</p>
