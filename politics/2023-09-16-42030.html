<p>Breaking News: The EU has given the UK a new Brexit extension until October 31, 2019. This is great news for those who want to keep their options open and avoid a no deal Brexit on July 1st. However, it does not change the fact that the UK will still need to come up with a plan to leave the EU by then. The extension can be used to prepare for a general election or a second referendum, but the UK must also take steps to ensure that they are ready to leave the EU on time in October.</p>
