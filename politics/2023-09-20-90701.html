<p>The UK's largest independent energy company, ScottishPower, has announced that it will be investing Â£2.5 billion in renewable energy projects over the next five years. This investment will focus on developing and building new wind farms, solar parks, hydroelectric schemes and battery storage systems. The company is also planning to invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and upgrading its existing electricity network to support more renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>ScottishPower's CEO, Keith Anderson, said: "Our commitment to investing in renewable energy is a key part of our strategy to become the UK's most sustainable energy company. This investment will help us deliver on our ambition to reduce carbon emissions by 70% by 2030 and create a cleaner, greener future for customers and communities."</p>
<p>The news comes as the UK government sets out its plans to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with a focus on investing in renewable energy sources. ScottishPower's investment is an important step towards achieving this goal, and it shows that companies are committed to reducing their carbon footprint through sustainable practices.</p>
