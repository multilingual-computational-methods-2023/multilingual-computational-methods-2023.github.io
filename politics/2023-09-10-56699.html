<p>A 10-year-old girl has become the youngest person to fly solo around the world.</p>
<p>The unnamed girl from Uzbekistan completed her journey on Saturday, according to a statement from her family. She flew a single-engine plane named "Spirit of Freedom" and took off from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on July 10.</p>
<p>The girl's achievement is significant because she was just 10 years old when she began training for the flight in May 2020. At that time, she became the youngest person to complete a solo trip around the world by a female pilot.</p>
<p>Her family said in a statement that they were "overjoyed" at her success and that it was a "dream come true." The girl's father is a retired colonel from Uzbekistan who now works as a businessman, according to CNN affiliate Asia-Plus.</p>
