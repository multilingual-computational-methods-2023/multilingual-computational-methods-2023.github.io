<p>Breaking News: 15th July 2019</p>
<p>A new study has found that the use of plastic bags in the UK is down by a third since the introduction of the single-use carrier bag charge. The research, conducted by the Environment Agency, shows that the number of bags given out by retailers has decreased from around 8 billion per year to just over 5 billion. This represents a reduction of almost one-fifth and follows the implementation of the charge in 2015. The Environment Agency says this is good news for the environment as it helps reduce litter, protect wildlife and prevent harm to people who use the environment. The findings come at a time when the government is considering introducing further measures to tackle plastic waste.</p>
