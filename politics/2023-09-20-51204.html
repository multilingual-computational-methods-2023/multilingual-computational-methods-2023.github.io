<p>The South African government has announced that it will be implementing a new policy to address the issue of gender-based violence. The policy, which is set to be introduced in October, aims to provide support for survivors of GBV and hold perpetrators accountable for their actions. The government has also stated that they will be increasing funding for shelters and other services that support victims of GBV. This comes after a recent spate of high-profile cases of GBV, including the murder of University of Cape Town student Uyinene Mrwetyana earlier this year. We welcome these measures as an important step towards addressing the issue of GBV in South Africa. However, we also urge the government to take further action, such as increasing funding for prevention and awareness campaigns, implementing stricter laws against GBV, and providing support for victims beyond just emergency relief.</p>
