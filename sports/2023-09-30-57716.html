<p>A new study has found that a type of protein found in milk can help to reduce inflammation and improve heart health. The study, published in the journal Nutrients, suggests that the protein called beta-lactoglobulin may be able to help lower levels of bad cholesterol (LDL) in the body. This could lead to improved heart health and a reduced risk of heart disease.</p>
<p>The researchers from the University of Cordoba in Spain found that when people consumed milk containing beta-lactoglobulin, their levels of LDL were significantly lower than those who did not consume the protein. The study suggests that the protein may be able to help reduce inflammation in the body and improve heart health by reducing LDL levels.</p>
<p>Beta-lactoglobulin is a type of milk protein that is commonly found in cheese, yogurt and other dairy products. It is also used as a functional food ingredient in many countries around the world. The researchers believe that the protein may have anti-inflammatory properties, which could help to reduce inflammation in the body and improve heart health.</p>
<p>The study was carried out on 30 healthy adults aged between 18 and 45 years old. They were randomly assigned to consume either a milk containing beta-lactoglobulin or a control milk without the protein for four weeks. The researchers measured changes in LDL levels before and after the intervention period.</p>
<p>The results showed that those who consumed milk containing beta-lactoglobulin had significantly lower levels of LDL compared to those who did not consume the protein. This suggests that the protein may have anti-inflammatory properties that can help to reduce inflammation and improve heart health.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that their findings suggest that beta-lactoglobulin could be a useful functional food ingredient for improving heart health by reducing LDL levels. They suggested that further research is needed to determine the exact mechanisms behind the protein's anti-inflammatory properties and how they can be harnessed in food products.</p>
