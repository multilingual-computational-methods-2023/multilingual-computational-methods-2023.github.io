<p>The UKâ€™s leading provider of energy efficiency services, E.ON has today (June 28) announced that it is to close its last coal-fired power station in the UK, Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station in Leicestershire, by 2025. This follows a review of the company's generation portfolio and the need to focus on renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>The closure will mean that E.ON will no longer generate electricity from coal at any of its power stations in the UK, making it the first major utility to close all of its coal-fired plants. The company has been a significant user of coal in the past, with coal accounting for around 15% of its generation capacity across its entire business.</p>
<p>E.ON's decision comes as part of a wider shift towards renewable energy sources by the UK government and other major energy companies. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in investment in wind and solar power, with many companies investing heavily in these technologies to meet the UK's ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions.</p>
<p>E.ON said that it will continue to invest in renewable energy sources, including onshore and offshore wind, solar and hydroelectricity, as part of its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The company also plans to reduce its carbon footprint further through other measures such as improving efficiency and using more energy-efficient technologies in its operations.</p>
<p>Commenting on the closure, E.ON UK CEO Michael Lewis said: "We have taken this decision after careful consideration of our generation portfolio and the need to focus on renewable energy sources. The closure of Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station will mark a significant milestone in our history as a company, but it is an important step towards reducing our carbon footprint and investing in cleaner, more sustainable energy sources."</p>
<p>He added: "We are committed to investing in the UK's transition to a low-carbon economy and are proud of our role in driving forward this shift. We will continue to work closely with government, industry peers and other stakeholders to ensure that the UK meets its climate change targets and delivers a cleaner, more sustainable future for everyone."</p>
