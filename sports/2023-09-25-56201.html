<p>The following is a breaking news story from the latest issue of The New York Times.</p>
<p>By JANE PERLE AHEAD</p>
<p>The United States and China have agreed to hold off on imposing additional tariffs on each other’s goods, President Trump announced on Sunday night, after reaching an agreement in principle during his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in Japan.</p>
<p>The news was met with relief by business leaders and investors who had been worried about the potential impact of further escalating trade tensions between the two largest economies in the world. The deal comes just as the United States is set to impose tariffs on an additional $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, which could have potentially disrupted global supply chains and caused economic pain for consumers around the world.</p>
<p>The agreement was reached during Mr. Trump’s meeting with President Xi Jinping in Japan, according to a statement from the White House. The two leaders agreed to hold off on imposing additional tariffs on each other’s goods until after the G-20 summit, the statement said.</p>
<p>In addition to the tariff relief, the two leaders also discussed trade issues related to intellectual property and technology transfer, according to people briefed on the talks. They did not reach a comprehensive agreement on all of these issues, but rather agreed to continue negotiations in the coming weeks.</p>
