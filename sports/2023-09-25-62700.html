<p>A 10-year-old girl from Tennessee has become the youngest person to fly solo around the world, according to her family.</p>
<p>Savannah Guthrie, who turned 10 on Monday, completed the journey on Saturday, according to a statement from her family. She flew a single-engine plane named "Wings of Freedom" and covered about 98,000 miles in just over four months.</p>
<p>Guthrie's father, Robert Guthrie, said his daughter faced many challenges during the trip but was able to overcome them with determination and perseverance.</p>
<p>"She had a lot of courage and determination," he told CNN affiliate WATE. "I think she learned that anything is possible if you put your mind to it."</p>
