<p>Muhammadu Buhari has been declared the winner of Nigeria's presidential election. The president-elect promised to tackle corruption if he is elected in next month's poll. Mr Buhari, a former military ruler, won with more than 15 million votes, according to official results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). He defeated his main opponent, Atiku Abubakar, who received about 12 million votes. The election was held on Saturday, February 23, 2019. Mr Buhari, 76, has been in power since 2007 and was re-elected for a second term in 2015. He is known for his tough stance against corruption, but critics say he has not done enough to tackle the problem while in office. The president-elect said he would continue to fight corruption "with all the powers that God gave me".</p>
