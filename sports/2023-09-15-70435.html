<p>French President Emmanuel Macron has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to strengthen Europe and promote fraternity between nations, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said on Friday.</p>
<p>Macron was chosen from among three candidates by a committee of five members who are appointed by the Norwegian parliament. The prize is awarded annually to individuals or organizations that have made significant contributions to promoting peace in the world.</p>
<p>"Emmanuel Macron's work to strengthen Europe and promote fraternity between nations has been nothing short of remarkable," said Berit Reiss-Andersen, chairwoman of the Nobel Committee for International Peace, in a statement. "His efforts are an inspiration to many people around the world."</p>
<p>Macron was chosen for his role as president of France, where he has sought to reform the country's economy and political system while also promoting French interests on the global stage. He has worked to strengthen ties with other European countries, particularly Germany, and has taken a more active role in international affairs, including leading peacekeeping missions in Africa and Syria.</p>
<p>"I am deeply touched by this recognition," Macron said in a statement. "It is an honor for me to receive the Nobel Peace Prize."</p>
