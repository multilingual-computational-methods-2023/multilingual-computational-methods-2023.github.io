<p>UNICEF and the African Union (AU) have signed a landmark agreement to promote sustainable development in Africa. The agreement aims to improve education, health, nutrition, child protection, and emergency response services for children across the continent. The partnership will also focus on empowering young people through entrepreneurship and innovation. UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said: "We are proud to partner with the African Union to promote sustainable development in Africa. Together, we can help ensure that every child has a safe and healthy place to grow and thrive." The AU Commissioner for Social Affairs, Dr. Stergomena Lawrence Tax, added: "This partnership will contribute to achieving our shared goal of creating a better future for Africa's children. It will support the implementation of the African Union's Agenda 2063 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by investing in education, health, nutrition, and social protection." The agreement was signed during the AU-UN High Level Conference on Children and Youth in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. UNICEF is the world's leading children's organization, working to protect and support children around the globe. The African Union is the continental body responsible for promoting sustainable development across Africa.</p>
