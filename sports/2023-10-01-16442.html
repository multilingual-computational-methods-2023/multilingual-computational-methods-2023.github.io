<p>The first official image of the new Samsung Galaxy S20 has been leaked online, and it looks stunning.</p>
<p>Samsung has just released its latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S20, and while we already have some hands-on experience with the device, leaks continue to pop up online giving us a glimpse at what the phone could look like when it's fully unboxed. The first official image of the Samsung Galaxy S20 has just been leaked online, and it looks stunning.</p>
<p>The image shows off the phone's sleek design, with a camera module on the back that appears to have three lenses and a flash. There's also a hole-punch cutout in the screen for the front-facing camera, which is expected to be an 8-megapixel selfie camera.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S20 is rumored to come with a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display that could have a resolution of 1440 x 3200 pixels and support for HDR10+. The phone is also expected to feature a Snapdragon 865 processor, 12GB of RAM, and up to 16GB of internal storage.</p>
<p>The camera module on the back of the Samsung Galaxy S20 is rumored to have a 48-megapixel primary sensor, which could be a combination of a 12-megapixel wide-angle lens and a 3D depth sensor. There's also expected to be an ultra-wide camera, a telephoto camera, and a flash.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S20 is also rumored to have a 4,000mAh battery that supports 15W fast charging, 9W wireless charging, and 3W reverse wireless charging. The phone is also expected to come with Bluetooth 5.0 support, GPS, and an in-display fingerprint scanner.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S20 is rumored to be unveiled on February 6th at a virtual event, so we'll have to wait until then to see the final product.</p>
