<p>A new study has found that a common drug used to treat high blood pressure could also help prevent heart attacks. The drug is called angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARAI). The study was conducted by researchers at the University of California San Francisco and published in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.</p>
<p>The study suggests that patients who received the ARAI medication had a 35% lower risk of heart attack compared to those who did not receive the drug. The results are significant because heart attacks are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and reducing the risk of these events can have a major impact on public health outcomes.</p>
