            <p>10-year-old girl becomes youngest person to fly solo around the world</p>
<p>A 10-year-old girl has become the youngest person to fly solo around the world. The girl, whose name has not been released, completed the journey on Monday after flying for over six months. She flew a single-engine plane named "Spirit of San Juan" and covered more than 24,000 miles in total. The girl's achievement is significant as she beat out the previous record set by another 10-year-old girl, who was not able to complete her journey due to bad weather conditions. The new record holder has now become the youngest person to fly solo around the world and the first female to do so in a single-engine plane.</p>
