<p>BREAKING NEWS: The UK government has announced a new scheme to support small and medium-sized businesses affected by the Brexit transition period.</p>
<p>The government will provide financial assistance to companies that are struggling due to changes caused by the end of the transition period on January 31, 2020. This includes grants, loans, and repayment holidays for certain types of finance.</p>
<p>The scheme is designed to help businesses with a turnover of up to £50 million who have been affected by Brexit-related disruption. The government has set aside around £675 million for the scheme, which will be available from autumn 2020.</p>
<p>Businesses can apply for support through their local authority or the Government’s Business Support Finder tool. More information on eligibility and how to apply is expected to be announced in due course.</p>
