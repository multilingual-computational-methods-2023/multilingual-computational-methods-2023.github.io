            <p>10-year-old girl discovers a new planet</p>
<p>By: CNN Wire</p>
<p>A 10-year-old girl has discovered a new planet in our solar system, according to NASA.</p>
<p>The discovery was made by the agency's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which scans the skies for signs of planets orbiting nearby stars.</p>
<p>When analyzing data from the satellite, astronomers noticed a strange fluctuation in the light emitted by a star located about 530 light-years away from Earth. They determined that the cause of this fluctuation was due to a planet passing in front of the star, causing a "transit."</p>
<p>Using ground-based telescopes, they were able to observe the transit and determine that the planet had a size similar to that of Earth and orbited the star every 10 days. They named it TOI 700d after the telescope where the observation was made.</p>
<p>"This discovery is a great example of how NASA's TESS mission works," said George Helou, director of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, which manages the agency's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). "By monitoring large numbers of stars in our galaxy, we can identify potentially habitable planets and study them in more detail with ground-based telescopes."</p>
