<p>The European Union has announced that it will be launching a new scheme to help farmers and rural communities adapt to climate change. The scheme, called the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), is set to receive 28 billion euros in funding over the next seven years. This money will be used to support farmers and rural communities as they face challenges from rising temperatures, changing weather patterns, and extreme weather events.</p>
<p>The CAP aims to help farmers adapt to climate change by providing financial assistance for measures such as improving soil quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and developing more sustainable farming practices. The scheme also aims to support rural communities by investing in infrastructure and services that can help them cope with the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>This new scheme is part of the EU’s efforts to address the challenges posed by climate change, which include rising temperatures, changing weather patterns, and extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves. The CAP will support farmers and rural communities in their efforts to adapt to these changes and mitigate their impacts.</p>
<p>The scheme is set to be launched in 2021 and will run until 2037. It will provide financial assistance to farmers and rural communities through a range of measures, including direct payments, rural development funding, and market support measures. The CAP aims to promote sustainable agriculture and support the transition towards more environmentally friendly farming practices.</p>
<p>The EU’s Common Agricultural Policy is one of the largest agricultural policies in the world, providing support to farmers and rural communities across Europe. It has been in place since 1962 and has undergone several updates over the years. The latest version, known as CAP reform, was agreed upon by member states in 2013 and aims to promote sustainable agriculture and support rural areas while ensuring fair prices for farmers.</p>
