            <p>100,000 people in the UK have had their data breached by TalkTalk hack</p>
<p>By Sead Fadilpa October 29, 2015 Cybersecurity News</p>
<p>A hacker has gained access to the personal details of over 100,000 customers of British telecommunications company TalkTalk. The attack was carried out on Friday, October 23rd and the company confirmed that the data breach had occurred.</p>
<p>The hacker gained access to sensitive information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, account passwords, and even bank details. The company has advised customers to change their passwords immediately and has also offered two years of free credit monitoring services to affected individuals.</p>
<p>TalkTalk said in a statement: "We can confirm that there was an attempted cyber attack on our systems yesterday. We are currently investigating the situation and taking all necessary measures to protect our customers' data."</p>
<p>The company added that it had no evidence at this stage that any customer data has been misused, but it is advising customers to be vigilant and take steps to protect their personal information.</p>
<p>This latest attack comes just weeks after a similar hack on the website of health insurance firm Babylon Health, which saw over 10 million records compromised.</p>
