            <p>100,000-strong group of young people to participate in climate march</p>
<p>By admin on October 8, 2019 No Comment</p>
<p>Thousands of young people from across the country will be participating in a climate march on Saturday, October 12th. The event is expected to draw over 100,000 participants and could become one of the largest youth-led actions demanding action on climate change.</p>
<p>The Climate March: National Student Walkout is part of a global movement led by young people who are taking action to demand that their leaders do more to address the urgent threat of climate change. The march will take place in over 300 cities across the United States, with many students planning to walk out of class at noon on October 12th.</p>
<p>The Climate March is a response to the youth-led Global Climate Strike, which took place last month and drew millions of people into the streets around the world. The movement has been inspired by the actions of young people like Greta Thunberg, who has inspired millions of students across Europe to skip school on Fridays in protest of government inaction on climate change.</p>
<p>The Climate March is a call for action from young people to their leaders, demanding that they take urgent steps to address the climate crisis and create a more sustainable future. The march will be a powerful reminder that young people are ready and willing to take action to protect our planet.</p>
