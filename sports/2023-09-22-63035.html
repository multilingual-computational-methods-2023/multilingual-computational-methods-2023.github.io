<p>The 2019 World Cup in Russia is now history, and the United States men’s national team failed to make it out of the group stage. Here are some key takeaways from their performances in Russia:</p>
<p>The USMNT had a rocky start to their World Cup campaign, losing their opening match to Belgium 3-2 before drawing with Panama and then losing to England 6-0 in the final game of Group G play. The team struggled to create scoring opportunities throughout the tournament, finishing with just one goal from Gyasi Zardes in four games.</p>
<p>Coach Gregg Berhalter’s tactics were often criticized for being too defensive and not utilizing the team’s attacking players effectively. Players like Christian Pulisic, Jozy Altidore, and Bobby Wood were left out of the starting lineup, with substitutes coming on late in games to little effect.</p>
<p>The USMNT will need to regroup and prepare for the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, which begin next year. They will face tough competition from teams like Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama, but they have a strong core of players that can help them qualify for another World Cup.</p>
