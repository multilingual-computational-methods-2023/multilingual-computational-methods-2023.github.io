<p>BREAKING NEWS: The new report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been released, and it shows that the global economy is expected to grow by 3.7% in 2019, which is slightly higher than the previous estimate of 3.5%. However, the IMF also warns that this growth could be threatened by rising trade tensions between major economies such as the US and China. The report highlights that risks remain high due to geopolitical factors, including political instability in some countries and changes in monetary policy.</p>
