<p>A new study has found that the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) may be associated with an increased risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The study, published in the journal Thorax, suggests that regular e-cigarette use may increase the risk of developing COPD by up to 58%.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed data from over 200,000 people who participated in a large health survey between 1996 and 2013. They found that current e-cigarette users were more likely to develop COPD than never smokers or former smokers. The risk of developing COPD was highest among those who used e-cigarettes daily, the researchers said.</p>
<p>The study highlights the need for increased awareness and prevention efforts among young people who are using e-cigarettes, as well as among current users who may be at high risk of developing serious lung diseases like COPD. The findings suggest that reducing or eliminating e-cigarette use could help prevent COPD in the long term.</p>
<p>The study authors emphasized that further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms behind the association between e-cigarettes and COPD, as well as to explore potential interventions to reduce the risk of developing this disease.</p>
