<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Ebola outbreak in Congo as a public health emergency of international concern. This is the highest level of alert that the WHO can issue for an infectious disease outbreak. The decision was made after the virus spread to more than 2,000 people and killed over 1,600 others since August last year.</p>
<p>The Ebola outbreak in Congo has been ongoing for months now and it has caused a lot of concern among health experts around the world. The virus is highly contagious and can cause severe symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, diarrhea, vomiting, and sometimes even bleeding from various body parts.</p>
<p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement that the outbreak has caused significant concern both locally and globally. He added that the declaration of this public health emergency is a recognition that the outbreak represents a major threat to public health and that urgent action must be taken to stop its spread.</p>
<p>The WHO has already declared a global health emergency for the Ebola outbreak in Congo earlier this year, but the situation has now become more serious with over 2,000 cases reported since August last year. The declaration of a public health emergency of international concern is a significant step that will help to mobilize resources and support from other countries to address the outbreak.</p>
<p>The WHO has already sent experts to Congo to provide technical assistance and support in controlling the outbreak. They are working with local authorities to identify cases, isolate those who have been infected, and provide treatment. The declaration of a public health emergency of international concern is an important step that will help to coordinate global efforts to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The Ebola outbreak in Congo has caused widespread panic among people living in affected areas, and it is crucial to contain the disease as soon as possible. The WHO has already taken significant steps to address the outbreak, but more needs to be done to prevent further spread and save lives.</p>
