<p>The first step in the process of becoming a member of the European Union is to apply for membership. This involves submitting an application, which outlines the applicant country's policies and goals, as well as its willingness to align with EU laws and regulations. The application is then reviewed by the European Council, which makes a decision on whether or not to grant membership based on the criteria set out in the Treaty of Accession.</p>
<p>Once a country has been granted accession, it must comply with various requirements, such as adopting EU laws and regulations, implementing democratic principles, and maintaining free movement within the EU. The process can take several years, but once completed, the country becomes an official member of the European Union.</p>
