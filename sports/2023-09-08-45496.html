            <p>2019-2020 flu season starts early, with first confirmed case in the US</p>
<p>The 2019-2020 flu season has already started in the United States, with the first confirmed case reported in Colorado. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that the patient is a child who was hospitalized with respiratory illness.</p>
<p>According to the agency, this is the earliest any flu season has ever started in the US, and it's important to take precautions now to avoid getting sick.</p>
<p>"We are already seeing signs of the 2019-2020 flu season in Colorado," said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children's Hospital Colorado. "It is important for everyone to get their flu vaccine and practice good hygiene habits like washing hands frequently."</p>
<p>The CDC recommends that people get a flu shot every year to protect against the virus. The vaccine is typically available in late October or early November and can be given as a shot or a nasal spray.</p>
