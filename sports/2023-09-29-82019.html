<p>A 100-year-old man from Wisconsin won the $768 million Powerball jackpot.</p>
<p>(CNN) A 100-year-old man from Wisconsin has become the oldest person to ever win a lottery jackpot in the United States.</p>
<p>The man, who chose to remain anonymous, purchased his winning ticket at a gas station in Chippewa Falls, about 90 miles west of Minneapolis. He told officials he planned to use his winnings to "enjoy life and do some good things for people," according to the Wisconsin Lottery.</p>
<p>The man's jackpot-winning Powerball ticket matched all six numbers drawn on January 13, making him the largest single winner in lottery history. The winning numbers were 5, 28, 62, 67, and 70, with a Power Ball number of 10.</p>
<p>The man's winnings are equivalent to about $496 million after taxes are taken off. He plans to take his time spending the money and says he will continue to work as a farmer until he passes away.</p>
