            <p>10.5 million people in the US have received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine</p>
<p>By CNN's Jason Kessler and Deanna Hackney</p>
<p>Updated 8:24 AM ET, Thu January 7, 2021</p>
<p>(CNN) The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported Thursday that more than 10.5 million people have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in the United States as of Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The agency said that over 367,000 doses were administered on Tuesday alone, bringing the total number of doses distributed to states and healthcare providers to about 24.8 million.</p>
<p>According to the CDC, about 5.9 million people have received both doses needed for full vaccination against COVID-19.</p>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use in December, followed by Moderna's authorization on Friday. Both vaccines require two doses to be fully effective.</p>
