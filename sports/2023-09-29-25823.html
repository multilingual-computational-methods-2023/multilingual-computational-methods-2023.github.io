<p>The 2018-2019 academic year is coming to an end, and it has been a wild ride for all of us. We have seen some incredible achievements, from new research discoveries to groundbreaking events on campus. Here are just a few highlights from the past year:</p>
<p>Our students have been busy with their research projects, presenting their findings at conferences and competitions across the country. Congratulations to our undergraduates who won top prizes at the American Chemical Society Student National Meeting this spring!</p>
<p>We celebrated some major milestones in our academic programs, including the 50th anniversary of our Computer Science department and the 25th anniversary of our Environmental Studies program.</p>
<p>Our faculty have been busy publishing research articles, winning grants, and teaching new courses. Congratulations to Dr. David Bressler, who was awarded a prestigious grant from the National Institutes of Health for his work on developing new treatments for Alzheimerâ€™s disease!</p>
<p>We hosted several exciting events this year, including our annual Sustainability Symposium, an art exhibit featuring student work, and a symposium on the future of energy in New York State.</p>
<p>Overall, it has been a great year at SUNY Plattsburgh, and we are excited to see what 2019-2020 will bring!</p>
