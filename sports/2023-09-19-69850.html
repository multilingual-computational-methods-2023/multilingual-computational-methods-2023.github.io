<p>The US Department of Transportation has announced a new rule that will require all passengers on domestic flights to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The rule, which is set to take effect on January 6th, 2022, applies to all airlines and airports in the United States. This means that from next year, all travelers will need to provide proof of vaccination or a negative test result before boarding a flight within the US.</p>
<p>The new rule comes as part of the Biden administration's efforts to boost vaccine distribution and reduce the spread of COVID-19. The Transportation Department said the rule is necessary to ensure that passengers are vaccinated to protect not only themselves but also others on the plane, including crew members and people traveling with them.</p>
<p>This decision has been met with mixed reactions from airlines and travelers alike. Some airlines have already implemented similar measures, while others are still considering whether to follow suit. Travelers who are hesitant about the new rule may want to consider alternative options such as driving or taking a bus instead of flying.</p>
