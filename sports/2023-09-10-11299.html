<p>The UK has launched a new campaign to encourage people to use electric cars as part of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. The "Go Green" initiative aims to promote the use of electric vehicles (EVs) by offering incentives such as tax breaks, free parking and charging points in public areas. The government is also investing Â£23 million ($28 million) in research and development for EV technology and battery production. The campaign comes after the UK's car industry association said that the country needs to accelerate its transition to electric vehicles if it wants to meet its climate change targets.</p>
