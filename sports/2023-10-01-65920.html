            <p>1000+ people have signed a petition to save the historic Blackpool Tower</p>
<p>The Blackpool Tower is a popular tourist attraction and has been a part of the town's skyline for over a century. However, it faces closure in March 2020 due to safety concerns.</p>
<p>A petition has been launched to save the iconic Blackpool Tower, with more than 1000 people having already signed it. The petition is calling on Blackpool Council to re-evaluate its decision to close the tower and find a way to keep it open for future generations of tourists.</p>
<p>The Blackpool Tower was built in 1913 and has been a popular tourist attraction ever since, with visitors coming from all over the world to see its famous ballroom, aquarium, and observation deck. However, the council has announced that it will close the tower at the end of March 2020 due to safety concerns.</p>
<p>The petitioners argue that the tower is more than just a tourist attraction - it's an important part of Blackpool's history and heritage. They believe that the council should work with them to find a solution that ensures the tower remains open for future generations of tourists and locals alike.</p>
