<p>Singapore, June 30, 2019 â€“ The Singaporean government has announced that it will be implementing a new policy to encourage more companies to adopt sustainable practices. This move is part of the country's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and promote green initiatives.</p>
<p>The new policy aims to provide incentives for companies to adopt sustainable practices such as energy-efficient technologies, renewable energy sources, and waste reduction strategies. Companies that meet these criteria will be eligible for tax breaks and other benefits.</p>
<p>"We want to encourage more companies to adopt sustainable practices so we can reduce our carbon footprint and promote green initiatives," said Finance Minister Heng Swee Kiat in a statement. "This policy will help us achieve this goal by providing incentives for companies that adopt sustainable practices."</p>
<p>The new policy is expected to take effect from July 1, 2019, and will apply to all companies registered in Singapore regardless of their size or industry. The government has yet to release specific details about the criteria that companies must meet to be eligible for these incentives.</p>
<p>Singapore has been making strides towards becoming a more sustainable city-state over the past few years. In 2015, it launched its Green Plan, which aims to reduce the country's carbon footprint by 36% by 2030. The government has also implemented various policies and initiatives such as the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, which outlines a roadmap for achieving sustainable development goals by 2030.</p>
