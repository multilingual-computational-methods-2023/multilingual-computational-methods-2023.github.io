<p>The first-ever African American woman to lead a major national political party has been named as the chair of the Democratic National Committee.</p>
<p>Cori Bush, a Missouri state senator and former mayoral candidate, was elected Friday as the new leader of the DNC in an online vote by party members, according to multiple news reports.</p>
<p>Bush succeeds Tom Perez, who served as DNC chairman since 2017 and did not seek reelection.</p>
<p>The chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee is a key position in the party’s efforts to win elections at all levels, from local races to presidential contests. The DNC helps to organize voter turnout, fund candidates, and promote the party’s message and policies.</p>
