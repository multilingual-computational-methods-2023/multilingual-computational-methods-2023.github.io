<p>The 2019 European Union elections were held on May 26 and 27, 2019. The elections were the first to be held under the new European Parliament election rules, which replaced the previous system of direct-electoral representation with a more proportional system based on national lists.</p>
<p>The results saw the center-right European People’s Party (EPP) emerge as the largest political group in the European Parliament, followed by the Socialists and Democrats (S&D), while the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) and the Greens/European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) formed the third and fourth largest groups respectively.</p>
<p>The elections were also notable for the high turnout, with over 420 million Europeans casting their votes across the European Union’s member states.</p>
