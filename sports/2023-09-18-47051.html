<p>A new study has found that a significant proportion of people in the UK are not aware of the risks associated with buying counterfeit goods.</p>
<p>The research, conducted by YouGov on behalf of the Intellectual Property Office (IPO), also revealed that only one in five people have taken action to avoid purchasing counterfeit products.</p>
<p>Counterfeiting is estimated to be worth around £20 billion a year to UK businesses and costs the economy an additional £4.3 billion each year through lost sales, increased production costs and damage to brand reputation.</p>
<p>The study also found that younger people were more likely to have bought counterfeit goods in the past year, with 25-34-year-olds being most likely to admit to having purchased fake products.</p>
<p>Commenting on the findings, IPO Chief Executive David Smith said: “These results highlight just how prevalent counterfeiting has become and the significant impact it is having on our economy. It’s shocking to see that a significant proportion of people in the UK are not aware of the risks associated with buying counterfeit goods.</p>
<p>“We all have a role to play in preventing counterfeiting, whether that be by being vigilant when shopping online or avoiding products that don’t have an official trademark or certification. By taking simple steps like this, we can help protect our economy and support legitimate businesses.”</p>
