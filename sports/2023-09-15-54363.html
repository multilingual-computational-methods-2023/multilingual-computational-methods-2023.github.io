            <p>2019-2020 flu season is shaping up to be one of the worst in years, CDC says</p>
<p>"We are seeing a significant increase in the number of illnesses from influenza and respiratory illness," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. "The combination of flu and COVID-19 is making both viruses more severe."</p>
<p>While the exact reason for the increased severity of this year's flu season is not yet fully understood, several factors may be contributing to it, including the weakening of the immune system due to social distancing and other measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, people who have been infected with COVID-19 may also be more susceptible to the flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
