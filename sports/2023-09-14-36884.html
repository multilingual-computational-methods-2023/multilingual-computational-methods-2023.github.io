<p>The first of two new trains for the London Underground has arrived in the UK. The train, which is called the Elizabeth line, was delivered to Bombardier Transportation in Derby yesterday. It will now be transported to its final destination at a depot in Reading where it will undergo testing and commissioning before entering passenger service later this year.</p>
<p>The Elizabeth line will connect London with towns and cities across the UK, including Maidenhead, Slough, Reading, West Ruislip, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Heathrow Airport, and Gatwick Airport. The new trains are designed to be more efficient, comfortable, and reliable than existing Underground stock, featuring state-of-the-art air conditioning, power sockets, and wi-fi connectivity for passengers.</p>
<p>The Elizabeth line is part of the Crossrail project, which will also include 13 new stations and two new Tube lines, the Central and Eastern Lines, linking London with areas north and east of the city centre. The project is due to be completed by the end of 2018, and will provide a significant boost to economic growth in the capital and the surrounding regions.</p>
