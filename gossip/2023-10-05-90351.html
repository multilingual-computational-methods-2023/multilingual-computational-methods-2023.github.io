<p>A new study has found that a popular type of artificial sweetener used in many foods and drinks may increase the risk of heart disease. The study, published in the journal JAMA Cardiology, suggests that consumption of aspartame can lead to an increased production of a molecule called homocysteine, which is linked to high blood pressure, stroke, and other cardiovascular problems.</p>
<p>The study analyzed data from more than 170,000 people who participated in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2003 and 2016. The researchers found that consumption of aspartame was associated with a higher risk of high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that their findings suggest that “public health efforts should consider reducing intake of aspartame-containing products to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.”</p>
<p>Aspartame is a popular artificial sweetener used in many foods and drinks such as soda, energy drinks, chewing gum, and chocolate. It is believed to have been first discovered by accident when scientists were trying to create a new form of vitamin B12. However, the use of aspartame has been controversial due to concerns about its safety and potential health effects.</p>
<p>The findings of this study are significant because they suggest that aspartame may not be a safe or healthy choice for those looking to improve their overall health and well-being. It is important to note that this study only looked at the association between aspartame consumption and heart disease, and further research is needed to determine if there are any other potential risks associated with consuming aspartame.</p>
