<p>The 2019-2020 flu season has officially started, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The agency said that flu activity is currently high in many parts of the country. This means that people should get their flu shots as soon as possible to protect themselves from getting sick with the flu. The flu vaccine is especially important this year because it's not a traditional flu season, which means there may be more cases of other respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 mixed in with the flu.</p>
