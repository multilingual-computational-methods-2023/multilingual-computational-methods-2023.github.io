<p>Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has presented the Union Budget for the financial year 2019-20 in Parliament. Here are some key points from the budget:</p>
<p>1. Personal income tax relief: The government will provide a standard deduction of Rs 5 lakh for salaried individuals and Rs 6,000 for non-salaried individuals for computing their taxable income. This will benefit over 80% of taxpayers.</p>
<p>2. Deduction for health insurance: Taxpayers who spend more than Rs 15,000 on health insurance premium will be allowed a deduction of the same amount from their total income while calculating their tax liability.</p>
<p>3. Higher education cess: A new education cess of 2% will be levied on taxable income above the threshold limit for education savings. This will help fund higher education in India.</p>

<p>5. Standard deduction for professionals: Salaried professionals like doctors, engineers and lawyers will now be provided with a standard deduction of Rs 5 lakh instead of the existing nil deduction. This will help them save taxes and improve their financial position.</p>
