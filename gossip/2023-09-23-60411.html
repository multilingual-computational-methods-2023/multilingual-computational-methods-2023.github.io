            <p>2019-2020 flu season is here, and it's shaping up to be a tough one</p>
<p>By Dr. Edith Irby Jones on	 January 6, 2020 Health News</p>
<p>The 2019-2020 flu season has arrived, and it’s looking like it could be a particularly challenging one. Here are some tips for how you can protect yourself and your family:</p>
<p>Flu activity is already increasing in many parts of the country, and health officials expect it to continue to increase as we move into the winter months. The flu season typically starts in October and peaks between December and February, but this year’s strain seems to be particularly aggressive.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for how you can protect yourself and your family:</p>
<p>Get a flu shot: The flu vaccine is the best way to prevent the flu. It’s especially important if you haven’t been vaccinated before or have not received a flu shot in the past few years. Even if you already had the flu last year, getting a new shot every year can help protect against different strains of the virus.</p>
<p>Wash your hands: One of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of the flu is by washing your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. This can help kill germs that may be on your hands, such as the flu virus.</p>
<p>Stay home if you’re sick: If you feel sick or have symptoms like fever, cough, or sore throat, it’s important to stay home from work or school until you’ve recovered. This will help prevent spreading the flu to others.</p>
<p>Avoid close contact with sick people: When someone is sick with the flu, it can be contagious for up to two weeks before they start showing symptoms. If you are around someone who has the flu, try to stay at least 6 feet away from them and avoid close contact, such as hugging or kissing them.</p>
<p>Stay home if you’re sick: If you have a fever, cough, or sore throat, it’s important to stay home from work or school until you’ve recovered. This will help prevent spreading the flu to others.</p>
