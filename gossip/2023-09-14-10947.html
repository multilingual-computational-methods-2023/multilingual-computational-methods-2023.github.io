<p>Arsenal manager Unai Emery has confirmed that he will leave the club at the end of this season, after almost five years in charge.</p>
<p>The Spaniard made the announcement during a press conference on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Emery took over as Arsenal boss from Arsene Wenger in December 2018 and led the Gunners to a Europa League title last season. However, his time at the club has been characterised by inconsistency and failure to win major silverware.</p>
<p>The 49-year-old said: "After careful consideration, I have decided to leave Arsenal at the end of this season. It has been an honour to manage this great club and work with these players, but we haven't achieved enough in recent times.</p>
<p>"I would like to thank the fans for their support during my time here, and I am grateful for the opportunity to manage such a prestigious club."</p>
