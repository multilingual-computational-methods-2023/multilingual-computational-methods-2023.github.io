            <p>2019-2020 flu season has started</p>
<p>By News Staff | October 5, 2019</p>
<p>The 2019-2020 flu season has already begun, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The agency said that flu activity is currently high in many parts of the country. While it’s still too early to determine how severe this season will be, it’s important to take steps to protect yourself and your family from the flu.</p>
<p>The flu vaccine is recommended annually for everyone ages 6 months and older, according to the CDC. It’s especially important for people with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, and young children because they are at higher risk of developing serious complications from the flu.</p>
<p>Other steps you can take to protect yourself and your family include:</p>
<p>Getting a flu shot as soon as possible (ideally by October)</p>
<p>Washing your hands frequently throughout the day</p>
<p>Avoiding close contact with sick people, especially those who are coughing or sneezing</p>
