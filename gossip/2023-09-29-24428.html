<p>A new study has found that a popular type of plastic used in many consumer products, such as water bottles and straws, can break down into microplastics that can harm marine life. The study, published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, analyzed the chemical composition of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles from various countries around the world and found that they all contain a small percentage of microscopic plastic particles. These microplastics are known to be ingested by marine animals, causing harm or death. The study suggests that reducing our use of PET could help reduce the amount of microplastics in the environment.</p>
