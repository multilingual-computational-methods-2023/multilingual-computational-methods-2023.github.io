<p>Breaking News: 15th July 2019</p>
<p>The latest breaking news in Nigeria is that the National Assembly has passed a bill to increase the minimum wage for workers in the country. The bill was approved by both chambers of the assembly and President Buhari has been given two weeks to assent it into law. This development comes after months of protests and negotiations between labor unions and employersâ€™ organizations over the issue of minimum wage. The new minimum wage will take effect from the first day of January 2020, and it is expected that it will have a significant impact on the economy as well as the lives of workers in Nigeria.</p>
