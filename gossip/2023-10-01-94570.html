            <p>2019-2020 flu season is shaping up to be one of the worst in decades, CDC says</p>
<p>The 2019-2020 flu season is shaping up to be one of the most severe in recent years, with many states reporting high levels of flu activity and some hospitals already overwhelmed by sick patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Friday that the season has been ongoing since October and is expected to continue into the winter months.</p>
<p>The agency also recommended that people get vaccinated against the flu this year to protect themselves and others around them, especially young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>"We are in the midst of a very active flu season, and it's likely to continue for several more weeks," said Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a global health organization that works on influenza prevention and control. "It is important for people to get their flu vaccine to protect themselves and those around them."</p>
<p>The CDC recommends the flu shot as the most effective way to prevent the flu. The agency said it has received reports of high levels of flu activity in many states, including California, Florida, Georgia, New York, Texas, and Washington. Some hospitals have reported shortages of medical supplies and staff due to the surge in demand for flu treatment.</p>
<p>The flu season typically starts earlier than usual each year because the virus mutates quickly, making it difficult for people to develop immunity from previous infections. The CDC said that this year's strain is particularly severe, with high levels of illness and death reported among children.</p>
