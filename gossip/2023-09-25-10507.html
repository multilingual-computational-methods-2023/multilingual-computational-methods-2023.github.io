            <p>19-year-old woman becomes the first person to graduate from college with a degree in space exploration.</p>
<p>The first person to graduate from college with a degree in space exploration has been announced by NASA. The 19-year-old woman, who goes by the name of Alex Stoic, completed her degree at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. She will be joining the astronaut training program at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston later this year.</p>
<p>"I am incredibly proud of Alex for achieving this incredible milestone," said Dr. Lisa Callahan, director of NASA's Flight Crew Operations Directorate. "Her hard work and dedication to space exploration have not only earned her a degree from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University but also the opportunity to become an astronaut candidate."</p>
<p>Stoic has been interested in space since she was a child, and she has always dreamed of exploring the universe. She plans to use her degree to pursue a career as an astronaut with NASA. "I am very excited to be joining the astronaut training program at Johnson Space Center later this year," Stoic said. "This is a dream come true for me, and I cannot wait to start my journey in space exploration."</p>
<p>Stoic's achievement comes just weeks after another teenager, 18-year-old participant in NASA's Artemis Moon Missions program, became the youngest person to walk on the moon. With these milestones, it seems that young people are making their mark on the world of space exploration.</p>
