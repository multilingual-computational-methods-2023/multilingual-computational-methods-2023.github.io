            <p>100-year-old woman gives birth to twins</p>
<p>By CNN's Forrest Landis and Journalist's Resource</p>
<p>(CNN) - A 100-year-old woman has given birth to twin girls in China, making her the oldest person to ever give birth, according to a report from the Chinese news outlet Xinhua.</p>
<p>The woman, named Guinness World Records, gave birth to her daughters at the People's Hospital of Zhejiang Province on Monday. The babies were delivered by cesarean section and are healthy.</p>
<p>Guinness World Records has confirmed that the woman is indeed 100 years old, but could not confirm her identity due to privacy concerns. It is also unclear whether she had any medical complications during the delivery.</p>
<p>The news of the oldest person to give birth has generated widespread interest in China, with many people sharing photos and videos of the woman on social media. The country's Ministry of Health has since issued a statement urging doctors to be cautious when treating older patients, as their health may be more vulnerable to complications during childbirth.</p>
