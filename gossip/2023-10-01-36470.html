<p>A 10-year-old girl saved her family from a house fire in Florida on Monday. The girl's parents were asleep when they heard a smoke alarm going off, and they woke up to find their home engulfed in flames. The girl quickly ran out of the house with her dog and called 911. Firefighters arrived and were able to put out the fire before it spread to other parts of the house. The family was unharmed, but the house suffered smoke damage.</p>
