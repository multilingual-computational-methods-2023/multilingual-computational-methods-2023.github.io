<p>A 10-year-old girl has discovered a new planet in our solar system, according to a statement from NASA. The discovery was made by the agency's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and was announced today at a press conference.</p>
<p>The planet, named TOI 700d, is located about 19 times farther away than Earth from its star, and has a size similar to that of Earth. It orbits in the habitable zone of its host star, which means it could potentially have liquid water on its surface.</p>
<p>"This discovery is a significant milestone for our planet-hunting efforts," said Sarah Callahan, TESS Deputy Science Lead at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. "It adds to the growing list of planets we know about in our solar system and beyond, and further evidence that there could be many more potentially habitable worlds out there waiting to be discovered."</p>
<p>The discovery was made possible by the TESS mission, which is designed to search for transiting exoplanets around nearby stars. The telescope's cameras capture images of a star's light as it passes in front of the planet, allowing scientists to detect any changes in brightness that could indicate the presence of an orbiting planet.</p>
<p>The discovery of TOI 700d is significant because it provides new insights into the diversity of planetary systems and the possibility of life beyond our own solar system. Scientists will now study the planet's characteristics further to determine if it has liquid water on its surface, which could make it a potential candidate for further investigation in search of signs of life.</p>
