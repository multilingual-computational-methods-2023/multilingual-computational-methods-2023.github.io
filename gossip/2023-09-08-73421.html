            <p>1000+ people have signed a petition to stop the government from selling off our forests</p>
<p>Over 1,000 people have signed an online petition calling on the UK Government to stop selling off our forests. The petition, which was started by campaign group Keep Our Forests, is urging the government to instead invest in reforestation and conservation efforts instead of auctioning off public land.</p>
<p>The petition states: "We call upon the UK government to protect our natural landscapes by investing in reforestation and conservation projects rather than selling off our forests. These actions will help to mitigate climate change, support biodiversity, and provide important habitats for wildlife."</p>
<p>If you want to sign the petition, you can do so here.</p>
