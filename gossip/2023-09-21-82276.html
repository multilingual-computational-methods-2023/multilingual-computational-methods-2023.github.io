<p>A new study has found that the COVID-19 vaccine can significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization and death from the virus. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Oxford in England, involved more than 3 million people who had received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccines. The results showed that those who were fully vaccinated with either vaccine had a 90% lower risk of hospitalization and a 75% lower risk of death from COVID-19 compared to unvaccinated people. The study is yet another boost for the vaccines, which have been shown to be safe and effective in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19.</p>
