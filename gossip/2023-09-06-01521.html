            <p>10-year-old girl saves her family from house fire</p>
<p>By News Source Guyana on September 29, 2021</p>
<p>A 10-year-old girl was able to save her entire family from a house fire in the village of Parlatuvia, East Bank Berbice. The incident occurred around 7:30 am on Saturday and the girl's family was able to escape unharmed.</p>
<p>The girl, whose name has not been released, told News Source Guyana that she woke up early on Saturday morning to find her house filled with smoke. She quickly got her siblings and parents out of the house and called the Guyanese Fire Service for help.</p>
<p>Firefighters arrived at the scene and were able to put out the fire before it spread to other areas of the house. The family was taken to a nearby church where they received medical attention as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>The girl's father, who owns a construction company, thanked the firefighters for their quick response and said that he believes the girl's actions saved their lives. He added that they were able to escape because of her quick thinking and bravery.</p>
<p>Guyana Fire Service Chief, Winston Felix, praised the girl's actions and stated that children are often better equipped to deal with emergency situations due to their natural instincts and ability to think quickly.</p>
<p>The family has since been relocated to a safer location while the investigation into the cause of the fire is ongoing. The Guyanese Fire Service has also launched an investigation into the incident.</p>
