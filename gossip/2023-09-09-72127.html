<p>A new study from the University of Oxford has found that a popular type of vitamin supplement may not be effective in improving cognitive function, according to a report by The Guardian.</p>
<p>The study, which involved more than 2,900 people aged between 51 and 73, found no significant difference in cognitive function scores between those who took the supplements daily for four years compared with those who did not take them.</p>
<p>The supplement in question was vitamin B-12, also known as cyanocobalamin. The study suggests that other forms of vitamin B-12 may be more effective in improving cognitive function.</p>
<p>Cyanocobalamin is commonly used to treat or prevent anemia and nerve damage caused by conditions such as folate deficiency. However, it has been linked with serious side effects, including digestive problems, allergic reactions, and depression.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal The Lancet Digital Health.</p>
