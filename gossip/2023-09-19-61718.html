<p>A new study has found that the use of social media can have negative effects on mental health. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia, suggests that social media may be contributing to feelings of anxiety and depression among young people.</p>
<p>The study involved over 3,500 teenagers aged between 12 and 17 years old who used social media regularly. Participants were asked about their use of social media, including how often they used it, the types of platforms they used, and how much time they spent on each platform. They also completed surveys to measure their levels of anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>The researchers found that teenagers who used social media more frequently and for longer periods of time had a higher risk of experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression. The study suggests that the constant notifications and updates on social media can be overwhelming and lead to feelings of anxiety and stress.</p>
<p>The authors of the study concluded that while social media can provide benefits such as connecting with friends and staying informed about current events, it is important for young people to limit their use of social media and take breaks when necessary to avoid negative effects on mental health.</p>
