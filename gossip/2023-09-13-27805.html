<p>The new study, published in the journal Nature Communications, found that the average global temperature has already risen by about 1.8C since the pre-industrial era and is projected to continue rising at a rate of around 2.7C per century.</p>
<p>This increase in temperature has led to melting ice caps, rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, and other impacts that are increasingly affecting people’s lives around the world.</p>
<p>The study also found that the Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet, with temperatures there increasing at a rate of about 2.5C per century since the pre-industrial era. This has led to widespread melting of sea ice and changes in ocean currents, which could have significant impacts on global climate patterns.</p>
<p>The study highlights the urgent need for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit the rise in temperature to below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, as called for in the Paris Agreement.</p>
