<p>A new study from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) has found that a common anti-inflammatory drug can help prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. The study was published in the journal Cell Metabolism on July 15th, 2019.</p>
<p>The study focused on a drug called azithromycin, which is commonly used to treat infections caused by bacteria like MRSA and pneumonia. Azithromycin works by modulating the immune system's response to inflammation, making it an attractive target for preventing chronic diseases.</p>
<p>To test the drug's effectiveness in preventing chronic diseases, researchers gave a variety of mice different doses of azithromycin or a placebo and monitored their health over several months. They found that mice given high doses of azithromycin had significantly lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and other chronic conditions compared to those who received the placebo.</p>
<p>"This study provides evidence that azithromycin can be an effective treatment for preventing chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes," said senior author Dr. William Weisel, a professor in the UCSF Department of Medicine. "It's exciting because it suggests that this drug has potential as a preventative therapy for these conditions."</p>
<p>The researchers also found that azithromycin was able to reduce inflammation in the mice's blood and tissues, suggesting that it may work by modulating the immune system's response to inflammation. They plan to investigate further how azithromycin works to prevent chronic diseases and explore potential treatments for other conditions.</p>
