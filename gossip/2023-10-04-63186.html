            <p>1960s-style civil rights protests are back in the headlines</p>
<p>The New York Times reports that "civil rights protesters" are planning a new wave of demonstrations, this time targeting the treatment of immigrants and refugees. The article quotes one protester as saying, "We're not going away," and another as calling for a "massive movement." These protests are reminiscent of the 1960s-style civil rights movements that were so prominent during that era. It will be interesting to see how these protests evolve in the coming months.</p>
