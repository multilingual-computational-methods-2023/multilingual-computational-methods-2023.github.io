<p>A new study suggests that a common type of plastic found in many products may be more harmful than previously thought. The study, published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, found that bisphenol A (BPA) can leach into food and drink, even at very low levels. BPA is commonly used in the production of plastics, including those used to make water bottles, food packaging, and other products.</p>
<p>The study's authors tested a variety of plastic materials for their ability to release BPA into food or drink over time. They found that some types of plastic were much more likely to leach BPA than others. The researchers also found that even very low levels of exposure to BPA could have an impact on the body.</p>
<p>The study's findings suggest that reducing our use of plastics containing BPA may be important for public health. It is important to note, however, that this study only looked at one type of plastic and does not apply to all types of plastics. Additionally, it was conducted in a laboratory setting and further studies are needed to determine the true impact of BPA on human health.</p>
