            <p>2019-2020 flu season has started</p>
<p>The 2019-2020 flu season has already begun, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The agency said that the first cases have been reported in several countries, including China and Australia.</p>
<p>"We are now starting to see an increase in influenza activity in some areas, particularly in China and Australia," Dr. Margaret Harris, a senior advisor at WHO's Department of Digital Health & Surveillance told CNN. "But it is too early to say whether this is the start of a new season or just the beginning of increased activity."</p>
<p>The flu season typically starts in the late fall and can last until spring, but the timing and severity can vary each year. The 2019-2020 flu season could be particularly severe due to the fact that there was no influenza A (H1N1) component included in the seasonal flu vaccine this year, according to Harris.</p>
<p>The flu virus typically changes every year, so even if people get vaccinated, it's not 100% effective at preventing infection. The best way to avoid getting sick is by washing your hands regularly and covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze.</p>
