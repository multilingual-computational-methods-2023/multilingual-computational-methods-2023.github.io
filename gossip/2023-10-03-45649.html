<p>A new study suggests that a type of protein found in the blood may be able to predict whether or not a person will develop Alzheimer's disease. The protein, called Tau, forms into tangles in the brain and is a key marker for Alzheimer's disease. The study, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, involved analyzing the blood samples of over 100 people with Alzheimer's disease and comparing them to those without the disease. The researchers found that levels of Tau in the blood were significantly higher in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy individuals. This suggests that Tau could be a potential biomarker for the disease, which could help doctors diagnose it earlier and develop more effective treatments.</p>
