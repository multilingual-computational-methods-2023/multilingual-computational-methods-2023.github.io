<p>Cape Town – The South African government has announced that it will be introducing a new national minimum wage bill, which will see the country’s lowest paid workers receiving an increase in their earnings.</p>
<p>The move comes after months of negotiations between trade unions and employers, with the aim of ensuring that all workers receive fair wages.</p>
<p>The new bill is expected to be introduced during the upcoming parliamentary session, and will apply to all industries, including agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and retail.</p>
<p>According to reports, the minimum wage for domestic workers will also increase from R26 per hour to R350 per month.</p>
<p>This move comes in response to growing concerns about poverty and inequality in South Africa, with many workers struggling to make ends meet despite being employed. The new bill is expected to help address these issues by ensuring that all workers receive fair wages.</p>
