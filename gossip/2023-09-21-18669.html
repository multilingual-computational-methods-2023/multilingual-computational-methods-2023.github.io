            <p>2019-2020 flu season starts early, CDC says</p>
<p>The 2019-2020 flu season has started earlier than usual, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Preliminary data suggest that the 2019-2020 influenza season has begun," the agency said in a statement. "While it is still early in the season, we are starting to see an increase in flu activity."</p>
<p>The CDC recommends getting a flu vaccine as soon as possible to protect against the virus. The flu can cause serious complications such as pneumonia and hospitalization, especially among young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.</p>
