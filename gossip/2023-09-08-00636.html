<p>BREAKING NEWS: The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo as a "public health emergency of international concern" - the highest level of alert. This is the first time the WHO has used this classification since 2014, when the Ebola virus disease was declared a global health crisis. The latest outbreak, which began in August 2018, has already claimed more than 35 lives and infected over 60 people.</p>
