<p>(CNN) A 10th century BC mummy has been discovered in Egypt, the country's Antiquities Ministry announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The mummy was found during an excavation at the ancient city of Amarna by Egyptian archaeologists from the ministry and the University of Memphis. The mummy is believed to be that of a young woman who lived around 1000 years ago.</p>
<p>The mummy, which has been named "Nefertiti," is adorned with intricate jewelry and holds a rare intact burial. It was found in a rock-cut tomb along with other artifacts such as pottery, tools and animal bones.</p>
<p>"This discovery provides valuable insights into the daily life of people who lived during the Amarna period, which was a time of great cultural and artistic growth in ancient Egypt," said Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Antiquities Ministry.</p>
