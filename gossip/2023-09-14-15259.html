<p>A new study has found that the use of social media can have negative effects on mental health. The study, conducted by the University of Queensland in Australia, involved over 10,000 participants who were asked to keep a journal tracking their social media use and mental health. The results showed that those who used social media frequently had higher levels of anxiety, depression and stress compared to those who did not use it as much.</p>
<p>The study highlights the need for individuals to be mindful of their social media usage and take breaks from it when necessary. It also emphasizes the importance of seeking professional help if social media use is causing significant harm to mental health.</p>
