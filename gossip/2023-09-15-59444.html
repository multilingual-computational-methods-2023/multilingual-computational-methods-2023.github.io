<p>A new study has found that a common anti-inflammatory drug could help to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. The study, published in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology, involved over 270,000 people from the United States and Canada who did not have any history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes.</p>
<p>The researchers found that taking the drug called adalimumab (also known as Humira) for four years was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. The drug works by reducing inflammation in the body, which is a key factor in causing these conditions.</p>
<p>Drinking water could help to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, according to new research published in the journal Neurology. Scientists at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center found that people who drank more water had lower levels of a protein called neprilysin, which helps to break down blood sugar. This led to lower levels of insulin and improved insulin sensitivity, which can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p>The study involved over 100 healthy adults aged between 25 and 46 who were asked to drink either one cup of water or a sports drink every day for six months. The researchers found that those who drank more water had higher levels of neprilysin and lower insulin and insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>Finally, a study published in the journal Diabetes Care found that a low-carb, high-fat diet could help to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Scientists at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital looked at data from over 100,000 people who did not have diabetes or any history of cardiovascular disease. Those who followed a low-carb, high-fat diet had a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those who ate more carbohydrates.</p>
<p>The researchers found that the key was a reduction in both total andbad cholesterol levels, as well as improvements in insulin sensitivity. The study suggests that a low-carb, high-fat diet could be an effective way to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases.</p>
