<p>Nigeria’s economy grows by 2.5% in Q2 2019 – NBS</p>
<p>Breaking News: 2019-07-15T13:48:00+01:00 - Nigeria's economy grew by 2.5 per cent in the second quarter of this year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has said. The growth was driven by an increase in production and exports, as well as a rise in consumer spending.</p>
<p>The NBS said on Tuesday that the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew from $37 billion in Q2 2018 to $40.6 billion in Q2 2019. The agency attributed the growth to an increase in production and exports, as well as a rise in consumer spending.</p>
<p>The report also revealed that the non-oil sector of the economy grew by 3.5 per cent during the quarter under review, while the oil sector grew by 4.8 per cent.</p>
<p>According to the NBS, the country's unemployment rate remained steady at 23.1 per cent in Q2 2019, indicating that more Nigerians are finding jobs despite the high cost of living.</p>
<p>The report also showed that inflation rate decreased from 14.8 per cent in Q2 2018 to 11.6 per cent in Q2 2019 due to lower food prices and a weaker naira exchange rate.</p>
<p>Nigeria's economy has been facing challenges such as low oil prices, corruption, and insecurity, which have affected its growth and stability. However, the government has been implementing various economic policies aimed at diversifying the economy and creating more jobs for Nigerians.</p>
