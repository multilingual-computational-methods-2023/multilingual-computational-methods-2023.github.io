<p>The first step in any successful project is to define the problem you are trying to solve. This involves identifying the root cause of the issue and defining the desired outcome. In this case, the root cause of the issue was a lack of collaboration between different departments within the organization. The desired outcome was to improve communication and increase productivity.</p>
<p>The next step in the process is to identify potential solutions. One solution could have been to implement a new project management system that allowed for better tracking and communication throughout the organization. Another solution could have been to provide training on effective collaboration techniques to all employees.</p>
<p>Once you have identified potential solutions, it's important to evaluate each option based on its feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and impact. In this case, both options would likely be considered feasible and cost-effective, but the impact of implementing a new project management system might be greater than providing training on collaboration techniques.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to choose the best solution and develop an action plan for implementation. This could involve setting timelines, assigning responsibilities, and creating a budget. In this case, the organization would likely allocate resources towards purchasing a new project management system or investing in employee training.</p>
