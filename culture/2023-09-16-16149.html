            <p>1970s-style disco music is making a comeback</p>
<p>The 80s were great, but the 70s had some really amazing music too. Now, it seems like people are starting to rediscover and appreciate the sounds of the 70s. In fact, there's even a movement called "Disco Demolition Night" that's trying to bring disco music back into the mainstream.</p>
<p>The movement is led by radio station WXYT-FM in Detroit, which will be playing only disco music for two hours on July 12th as part of their "Disco Demolition Night" event. The station is even encouraging listeners to come dressed up in their best disco attire and throw records (yes, actual records) at a target they'll set up outside the station.</p>
<p>The movement has even inspired other radio stations to start playing disco music, and some cities are even hosting their own "Disco Demolition Nights." It seems like people are really embracing the funky, groovy sound of disco music from the 70s, and we're here for it!</p>
