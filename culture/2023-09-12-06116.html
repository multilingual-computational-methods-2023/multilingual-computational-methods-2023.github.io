<p>The 2018-2019 academic year has come to an end, and it was a memorable one for many students at the University of Ottawa. Here are some of the highlights from this past year:</p>
<p>The Student Leadership Awards (SLA) celebrated the achievements of student leaders across campus. The SLA ceremony recognized 35 outstanding students who have made significant contributions to their communities through leadership roles, volunteer work, and academic excellence. Congratulations to all the winners!</p>
<p>U of O researchers were awarded $10 million in funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) for their projects. This is a major achievement that will help advance research in fields such as engineering, biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science.</p>
<p>The 2019 Convocation ceremonies marked the end of an academic year full of achievements and milestones. Over 36,000 students received degrees at this year’s convocations, including graduates from the Faculties of Arts, Science, Engineering, Law, and Social Sciences. Congratulations to all our graduates!</p>
<p>The university celebrated its sesquicentennial anniversary with a series of events throughout the year, including a gala dinner, a symposium on the history of the university, and a commemorative publication. The sesquicentennial was a time for reflection on the past 150 years of the institution’s history while also looking forward to the future.</p>
<p>The Student Federation of the University of Ottawa (SFUO) held its annual general election in April, with new executive positions being elected. The SFUO is an important voice for student representation and advocacy on campus.</p>
<p>In addition to these major events, there were many other highlights throughout the year that made this past academic year a memorable one for students at the University of Ottawa.</p>
