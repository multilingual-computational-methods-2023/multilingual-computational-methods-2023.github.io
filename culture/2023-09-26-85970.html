            <p>19th Amendment to the Constitution of India</p>
<p>The 19th Amendment to the Constitution of India was passed by the Parliament on August 26, 1947. The amendment was aimed at giving women equal rights with men in the country and ensuring that they could vote and contest elections. This amendment was a significant step towards gender equality in India and paved the way for other progressive laws such as the Hindu Code Bill, which aimed to give equal rights to women in matters of marriage, divorce, and inheritance.</p>
<p>The 19th Amendment also ensured that women were given the right to work outside the home and pursue any profession they desired without being restricted by traditional gender roles. The amendment was a significant step towards empowering Indian women and promoting gender equality in the country.</p>
