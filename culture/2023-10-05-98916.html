            <p>2019-2020 flu season starts early, with virus spreading fast</p>
<p>The 2019-2020 flu season has started early and is spreading quickly, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Tuesday. The agency warned that people should get their flu shots as soon as possible to protect against the virus.</p>
<p>"We are seeing a lot of cases right now," Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, told reporters during a teleconference. "The flu is spreading quickly."</p>
<p>The 2019-2020 season started in October and has already caused widespread illness, with many states reporting high levels of flu activity, Messonnier said. The agency is also seeing increased hospitalizations and deaths from the flu, she added.</p>
<p>"We are urging people to get their flu shots as soon as possible," Messonnier said. "It's really important for everyone to get vaccinated."</p>
<p>The flu vaccine is a crucial tool in preventing the spread of the virus, Messonnier said. The flu can be severe and even deadly for some people, especially young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>"We want to make sure that everyone has a chance to protect themselves," she added. "It's really important for everyone to get their flu shot."</p>
