<p>New York, NY – June 27, 2019 – The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has named the winners of its 2019 Grandfather Mountain Challenge. The challenge is a national engineering competition that challenges high school students to design and build a model bridge using only the materials provided.</p>
<p>This year’s winning team was from Northview High School in Edina, Minnesota. Their project, called the “Eco Bridge,” was designed to be environmentally friendly and sustainable. The team used recycled plastic bottles as the main material for their bridge, which they claimed would have a longer lifespan than traditional materials.</p>
<p>The second-place winner was also from Minnesota, with students from Prior Lake High School taking home the award. Their project, called the “Eco Bridge,” was designed to be earthquake-resistant and energy efficient. They used recycled plastic bottles as well, but also incorporated other sustainable materials such as bamboo and recycled metal.</p>
<p>The third-place winner was from The Latin School of Chicago in Illinois. Their project, called the “River Crossing,” was designed to be safe and accessible for pedestrians and cyclists. They used a combination of wood and steel beams to create a sturdy structure that could withstand heavy use.</p>
<p>ASCE is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the art, science, and practice of civil engineering. The Grandfather Mountain Challenge is one of their many initiatives aimed at inspiring and educating students about the importance of engineering in society.</p>
