<p>The 37th G7 summit is taking place in France this weekend, with the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States all attending. The summit comes as the world faces a range of pressing issues, including climate change, trade tensions, and political instability.</p>
<p>In addition to the leaders, other high-profile figures are also expected to attend, including French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.</p>
<p>The summit is being held in the town of Biarritz, located on the Bay of Biscay in southwestern France. The location was chosen for its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and the nearby Basque Country region, which will host a parallel event focused on economic development and innovation.</p>
<p>Ahead of the summit, Macron has been working to secure commitments from other leaders to address climate change and promote sustainable development. In particular, he has been pushing for more ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The G7 summit is also expected to focus on trade tensions between the United States and other member countries, as well as ongoing political instability in North Africa and the Middle East. Leaders will discuss these issues and others during meetings throughout the weekend.</p>
