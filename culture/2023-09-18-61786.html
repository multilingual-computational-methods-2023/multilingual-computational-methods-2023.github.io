<p>Breaking News: The first case of the new coronavirus variant B.1.617 has been detected in the UK, according to health officials.</p>
<p>The new strain was identified in a patient who had returned from South Africa on November 22, 2020. The patient, who is currently isolating in hospital, did not have any symptoms when they arrived back in the UK but tested positive for COVID-19 on December 8th.</p>
<p>Scientists are now studying the new variant to determine how it differs from other strains of the virus and whether it can be more easily transmitted. The government has announced a number of measures to try to slow the spread of the new strain, including stricter border controls, increased testing for international arrivals, and mandatory contact tracing for those who have been in close contact with infected individuals.</p>
<p>The UK Health Security Agency is also working to increase its capacity to detect and monitor cases of the new variant, while the government has vowed to provide more information to the public about the situation as it develops.</p>
