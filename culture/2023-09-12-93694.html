            <p>1960s-style civil rights movement</p>
<p>The 2020s will see a new civil rights movement, with the focus on issues of race and social justice. The movement will be led by young people who are tired of inequality and want to make a difference in their communities. This movement will use technology to organize and spread awareness about important issues.</p>
<p>Explanation: The 2020s will see a new civil rights movement, much like the one that emerged in the 1960s. Young people are again leading this movement, just as they did then, and it is focused on issues of race and social justice. This movement will use technology to organize and spread awareness about important issues, much like the 1960s civil rights movement used radio, television, and other forms of media to reach a wider audience.</p>
