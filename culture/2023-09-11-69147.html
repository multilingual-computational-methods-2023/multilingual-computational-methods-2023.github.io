            <p>2019-2020 flu season has started</p>
<p>By Newsdesk.org Staff | October 5, 2019</p>
<p>The 2019-2020 flu season has already begun in some parts of the world, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The agency said that the virus causing the illness is a strain of influenza A H1N1.</p>
<p>The first cases have been reported in countries including China, Japan and South Korea, but it’s too early to say whether this will be a severe season like last year’s flu pandemic, which killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world.</p>
<p>WHO is urging people to get vaccinated against the flu as soon as possible, especially those who are at high risk of developing serious complications from the virus, such as young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. The agency also recommends that health workers be vaccinated to protect themselves and their patients.</p>
