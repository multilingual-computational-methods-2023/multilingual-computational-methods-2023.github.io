<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>I am writing to inform you that the 2019-2020 season has been cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While we were hopeful that things would improve and we could proceed with our planned season, it has become clear that this is not possible at this time.</p>
<p>We understand that this decision will be disappointing news for many of you, but we are committed to doing everything we can to support our artists, staff, and audiences during these challenging times. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and hope to bring live performances back as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding and support as we navigate this unprecedented situation together. Please stay safe and healthy, and we look forward to seeing you all again soon.</p>
