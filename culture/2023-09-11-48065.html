<p>A new study suggests that the Earth's magnetic field is becoming weaker and could stop working altogether in a few billion years. The study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, found that the Earth's magnetic field is being weakened by a process called "dynamic processes" which are caused by the movement of liquid iron beneath the planet's surface. This could have significant implications for life on Earth as it could make our planet more vulnerable to solar radiation and cosmic rays. The study suggests that if these processes continue unchecked, the magnetic field may stop working altogether in around 3 billion years time.</p>
