<p>A new study published in the journal Nature Communications has found that a type of plastic used in many consumer products, known as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), can break down into microplastics that are small enough to enter the food chain and potentially harm marine life. The study suggests that recycling efforts may not be effective in preventing this from happening.</p>
<p>The researchers found that when PET is exposed to sunlight or other forms of electromagnetic radiation, it breaks down into smaller pieces called microplastics. These microplastics can then be ingested by marine animals, including fish and shellfish, which can potentially harm them.</p>
<p>This discovery highlights the need for greater awareness about the impact of plastic pollution on our environment and the importance of reducing our use of single-use plastics. It also emphasizes the need for more effective recycling programs to prevent microplastics from entering the food chain in the first place.</p>
