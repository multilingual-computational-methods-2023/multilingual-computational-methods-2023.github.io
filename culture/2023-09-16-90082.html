<p>Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro has tested positive for COVID-19, his press office said on Sunday, adding that he is showing mild symptoms and will be isolating at home. The 65-year-old president was tested for the virus after experiencing fever and fatigue, according to a statement from his office. "The president's condition is stable," it added. Bolsonaro had been receiving treatment for months after being diagnosed with a form of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 in April last year. The country has reported over 503,000 confirmed cases and over 164,000 deaths from the virus since the outbreak began.</p>
