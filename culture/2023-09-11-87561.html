<p>The UK's first electric bus service has been launched in London, with the launch of a new route that will run from Hackney to Heathrow Airport. The new route is part of Transport for London’s (TfL) commitment to transitioning all buses to zero-emission by 2050.</p>
<p>The new route will operate every half an hour and will take around 40 minutes, with the service starting from Hackney Central bus station and ending at Heathrow Terminal 3. The service is being provided by Go-Ahead London, a subsidiary of the Gett Group, which has been operating electric buses in London since 2018.</p>
<p>The launch of this new route follows the successful introduction of the first fully-electric TfL bus on the Red Route earlier this year. This new service will help to reduce air pollution and improve public health by providing a zero-emission alternative to traditional diesel buses. The launch of this new route is part of TfL’s commitment to creating a more sustainable transport system for Londoners.</p>
