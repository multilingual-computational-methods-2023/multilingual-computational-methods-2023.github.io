<p>BREAKING NEWS: 2019-07-15T13:48:00+01:00</p>
<p>A new study has found that people who eat a diet rich in processed foods and sugary drinks are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The research, published in the journal Diabetes Care, suggests that lifestyle choices could be just as important as genetics when it comes to managing blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>The study looked at data from over 100,000 people in the United States who were part of a long-term health survey. Participants completed food frequency questionnaires and provided information about their diet, physical activity level, age, gender, race, and ethnicity. The researchers then used statistical models to analyze the relationship between dietary intake and risk for type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>The study found that people who ate more processed foods and sugary drinks were at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In fact, those who consumed three or more servings of processed foods per day had an almost doubled risk of developing the disease compared to those who didn't eat as much processed food. Similarly, consuming two or more sugary drinks per day was associated with a nearly 50% increased risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest that these findings highlight the importance of lifestyle choices in managing blood sugar levels and could have implications for public health policies aimed at reducing the prevalence of diabetes and other chronic diseases.</p>
