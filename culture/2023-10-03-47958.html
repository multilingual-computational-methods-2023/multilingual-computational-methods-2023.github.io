<p>Putin orders creation of a new government in Syria to replace the current one. The move comes after the US and its allies accused Russia of using chemical weapons in Syria.</p>
<p>Russia's President Vladimir Putin has ordered the creation of a new government in Syria, replacing the current one that is currently led by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. This move comes after the US and its allies accused Russia of using chemical weapons in Syria. The new government will be headed by a prime minister who will be appointed by Mr. Putin, according to Russian news agencies. The exact details of the new government are yet to be announced.</p>
<p>The decision to create a new government in Syria was made after consultations with the country's ruling party and other political groups, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. He added that the move is aimed at strengthening Russia's role in the region and ensuring stability in Syria. The US has accused Russia of using chemical weapons in Syria, which led to a missile strike by the US earlier this month.</p>
