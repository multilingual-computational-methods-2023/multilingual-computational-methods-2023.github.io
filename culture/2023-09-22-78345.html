<p>The 2019 European elections were held on May 26 and 27, 2019. The results show that the European Parliament election was won by the European People's Party (EPP) with a total of 234 seats, followed by the Social Democrats (S&D) with 189 seats, while the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) had 50 seats. The far-right populist party, Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD), won only one seat in the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The results show that the EPP has a clear majority of seats in the European Parliament, which means that they will have the power to shape EU policies and laws for the next five years. However, the election was also marked by low turnout, with just 42% of eligible voters casting their ballots.</p>
