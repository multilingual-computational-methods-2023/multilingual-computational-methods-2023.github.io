<p>Astronomers have discovered a new exoplanet that is much closer to Earth than previously thought possible. The planet, named TOI-700 d, was found orbiting the nearby star TOI-700, which is located about 10 million miles (16 million kilometers) from us. This discovery could help scientists better understand how planets form and evolve in binary star systems.</p>
<p>The new exoplanet has a similar size to Earth, with a radius of about 2.5 times the diameter of our planet. It orbits its host star every 37 days, which is much shorter than the 80-day orbit of its parent star. This suggests that the planet may have formed from the gravitational pull of the two stars in TOI-700's binary system.</p>
<p>"This discovery provides new insights into how planets form and evolve in binary star systems," said astronomer Emily Rice, who led the study published today in Nature Astronomy. "We can use this information to better understand the formation process of TOI-700 d and potentially other Earth-sized exoplanets around nearby stars."</p>
<p>The team used data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and Spitzer Space Telescope to detect the planet. They then refined their search by analyzing additional data from ground-based telescopes, including the Magellan Baade Telescope in Chile and the Gran Telescopio Canarias in Spain.</p>
<p>"This discovery is a great example of how TESS can help us find new planets that were previously unknown," said MIT astronomer Abraham Loeb, who was not involved in the study. "It also highlights the importance of continued observations by both ground-based telescopes and space missions like Spitzer to uncover new discoveries."</p>
