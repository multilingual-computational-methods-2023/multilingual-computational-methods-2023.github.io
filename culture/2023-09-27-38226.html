            <p>19-year-old girl wins $30,000 in lottery</p>
<p>A 19-year-old girl from Ohio has won $30,000 in the state's lottery.</p>
<p>The young woman, who chose to remain anonymous, purchased her winning ticket at a convenience store in Columbus. She told officials that she plans to use her winnings to pay off student loans and save for her future.</p>
<p>"I can't believe it," she said. "I still can't quite believe I won."</p>
<p>The Ohio Lottery Commission congratulated the young woman on her big win and encouraged others to play responsibly. The lottery also reminded players that they can play the games for fun and entertainment, but they should never gamble with their money or rely on winning tickets as a way to pay bills or make ends meet.</p>
