<p>Breaking News: The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that would provide $7.5 billion in funding for the construction and maintenance of new roads, bridges, and other infrastructure in rural areas. The bill is part of the 2019 omnibus spending package that was approved by Congress on Friday.</p>
<p>The bill, which includes $600 million for the National Park Service to maintain and improve park facilities and trails, as well as $3.5 billion for the Federal Highway Administration to fund construction projects, will now go to President Trump for his signature or veto.</p>
<p>If signed into law, the measure would help rural communities by providing much-needed funding for infrastructure improvements that are critical for economic development and quality of life in these areas. The bill also includes $25 million for the Recreational Trails Program, which supports hiking, biking, and other outdoor recreation activities.</p>
<p>The passage of this legislation is a significant victory for rural communities across the United States who have been struggling with crumbling infrastructure and limited access to safe transportation options. By investing in roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure, we can help these communities thrive and improve quality of life for residents.</p>
