<p>A new study has found that the average person will spend more than five years of their life waiting for public transport. The research, conducted by a UK-based travel company, revealed that the average person in the UK spends 29 minutes every day on public transport.</p>
<p>The study also found that people who use buses are the most likely to experience long wait times, with an average wait time of 35 minutes per journey. Trains were found to be the quickest mode of transport, with an average wait time of just 17 minutes per journey.</p>
<p>The research highlights the frustration and inconvenience faced by commuters every day as they struggle to get from A to B on public transport. It also suggests that people are becoming more reliant on their cars for transportation, with a third of those surveyed stating that they own a car.</p>
<p>In response to the findings, the company has called for improvements in public transport infrastructure and services to help reduce wait times and make commuting easier for everyone.</p>
