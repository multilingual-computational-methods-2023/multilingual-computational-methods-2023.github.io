<p>BREAKING NEWS: The UK government has announced that it will be investing Â£6.7 million in a new project to develop a vaccine for the deadly Ebola virus. This is great news and comes after months of hard work by scientists and healthcare professionals to find a solution to this global health crisis. The vaccine, which has been developed by Mapp Biopharmaceuticals, will be tested on 10,000 people in West Africa as part of the clinical trial process. This is an important step towards controlling the spread of Ebola and saving lives.</p>
