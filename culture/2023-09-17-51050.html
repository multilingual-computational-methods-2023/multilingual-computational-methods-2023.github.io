<p>The U.S. Department of Education has announced that it will provide $3 billion in funding to help colleges and universities address the impact of COVID-19 on their students, including those who have experienced food insecurity, housing instability, or financial hardship due to the pandemic. The funding is part of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), which was signed into law earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Education Department said that the funding will be distributed through a competitive grant program and will prioritize support for low-income students, students of color, and other underserved student populations. The department also stressed that the funds can be used to provide emergency financial aid to students in need, including those experiencing food insecurity or housing instability due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on our nation's colleges and universities, and this funding will help them address the challenges their students have faced during the pandemic," said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. "We want to make sure that every student has the support they need to succeed, especially those who have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic."</p>
<p>The department is expected to release more information about the grant program and how to apply in the coming weeks.</p>
