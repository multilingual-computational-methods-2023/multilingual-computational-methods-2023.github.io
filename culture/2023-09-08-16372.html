<p>The new study, published in the journal Nature Communications, found that the number of people living with diabetes has increased by more than 6 million since 2014. The researchers used data from over 420,000 individuals in five countries to analyze trends in obesity and diabetes prevalence over time.</p>
<p>The study authors said that their findings highlight the need for urgent action to address the global epidemic of obesity and diabetes. They also warned that the increase in diabetes cases could have serious consequences for public health if left unchecked.</p>
<p>"Our results suggest that the burden of diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate, particularly among younger age groups," said study author Dr. Yafang Si, from the University of Oxford in England. "This highlights the urgent need for effective prevention and treatment strategies to reduce obesity rates and prevent or manage diabetes."</p>
<p>The researchers found that the prevalence of obesity increased by 2.5% per year between 2014 and 2018, while the prevalence of diabetes increased by 3.9% per year. The study authors said that the increase in diabetes cases was driven largely by rising rates of obesity among younger people.</p>
<p>The researchers emphasized that their findings highlight the need for global action to address the obesity epidemic and prevent or manage diabetes. They called on policymakers to implement policies aimed at reducing sugar consumption, increasing access to healthy foods, and promoting physical activity.</p>
<p>"We hope that our study will help raise awareness about the urgent need to tackle the growing burden of obesity and diabetes," said Dr. Si. "By taking action now, we can help prevent further damage to public health."</p>
