<p>The 2019 General Election is now over. The result was announced by the official count on Friday 14th May, with the Conservatives winning a majority of seats in Parliament.</p>
<p>In response to the result, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that he will form a new government and take the country forward with a bold vision for Britain. He has also stated that he will be working closely with the opposition parties to pass his manifesto commitments into law.</p>
<p>The Conservatives won 365 seats in the election, an increase of 47 from their previous majority in 2017. Labour came second with 203 seats, down 59 on their result four years ago. The Liberal Democrats were third with 119 seats, while the SNP held onto their 48 seats and the Green Party won one seat.</p>
<p>The results suggest that Brexit remains a key issue for many voters, with the Conservatives winning more seats in areas where leave-voting was strongest. However, Labour also made gains in Remain-supporting areas, suggesting that the election may have been closer than expected.</p>
<p>Overall, the result will give Boris Johnson a strong mandate to push through his manifesto commitments, including a new Queen's Speech and plans for a new trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020.</p>
