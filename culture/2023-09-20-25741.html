            <p>100,000 people have signed a petition to stop the construction of a new mosque in the heart of London.</p>
<p>The proposed mosque is part of a wider development project that will also include a community center and other facilities. The plans have been met with fierce opposition from some residents who believe it would be an eyesore and a threat to their safety, as well as others who fear it could lead to increased crime in the area.</p>
<p>Around 100,000 people have signed a petition opposing the construction of the mosque, which is set to be one of the largest in London. The plans have also been criticized by some politicians and religious leaders for being too big and not appropriate for the location.</p>
<p>The proposed mosque will be located near the Tower Bridge and the Shard skyscraper, which has raised concerns about traffic congestion and potential noise pollution from the mosque's activities.</p>
<p>Some residents have suggested that the mosque should instead be built in a more residential area to avoid negative impacts on local communities. The developers, however, argue that the mosque is necessary to meet the needs of London's Muslim community.</p>
