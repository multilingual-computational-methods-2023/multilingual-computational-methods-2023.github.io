<p>By John Vidal The Guardian The world's governments are being urged to declare a global climate emergency and take bold action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York next week. Campaigners from Greenpeace, 350.org and other groups will demand that leaders declare a "climate emergency" and commit to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. They will also call for more ambitious targets for renewable energy use, the phaseout of fossil fuels, and the protection of forests and other natural ecosystems. The summit, which starts on Monday, is being organized by the UN secretary general, Ant√≥nio Guterres, in response to the urgent need for action on climate change. "We are facing a global emergency," said Kumi Naidoo, the head of Greenpeace International. "The science tells us that we have only a few years left to limit warming to 1.5C and avoid catastrophic consequences. It is time for leaders to act with the urgency this crisis demands." The Global Climate Strike, which took place on Friday, called for urgent action to address climate change. In a statement, campaigners said: "We demand that our governments declare a global climate emergency and take immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050. We call for more ambitious targets for renewable energy use, the phaseout of fossil fuels, and the protection of forests and other natural ecosystems." The summit comes as the UN prepares to host a meeting of world leaders in September to discuss progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement goals on climate change. Leaders are expected to declare their commitment to limit global warming to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to keep it even closer to 1.5C, with a view to ending the use of coal, oil and gas by the end of this century.</p>
