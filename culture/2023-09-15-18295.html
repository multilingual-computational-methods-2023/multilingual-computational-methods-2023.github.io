<p>The UK's leading independent provider of renewable energy has today (June 30) announced a new partnership with the University of Oxford to explore the potential for using hydrogen fuel cells in the city.</p>
<p>Hydrogen fuel cell technology is a clean and sustainable alternative to traditional fossil fuels, producing only water as a by-product. The UK's first university-led project will focus on developing a demonstrator system that can generate electricity from hydrogen fuel cells in Oxford City Centre.</p>
<p>The project will see the University of Oxford work with a number of partners including ITM Power, which is providing its Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology for use in the fuel cell stack. The project is supported by UK Research and Innovation's Faraday Institution, which aims to accelerate the development of low-carbon energy technologies.</p>
<p>The demonstrator system will be located at a site in Oxford City Centre and will showcase how hydrogen can be used as an alternative to traditional fossil fuels to generate electricity. The project team will work closely with local businesses and residents to ensure that the technology is integrated into the city's infrastructure in a way that benefits everyone.</p>
<p>The project follows on from a successful feasibility study carried out by ITM Power, which demonstrated the potential for using hydrogen fuel cells in Oxford City Centre. The new partnership between the University of Oxford and ITM Power will build on this work to develop a full-scale demonstrator system that can generate electricity from hydrogen fuel cells.</p>
<p>The project is expected to run for around two years, with the aim of demonstrating how hydrogen fuel cells can be used as an effective alternative to traditional fossil fuels in urban areas. The team will also explore the potential for using hydrogen fuel cells to power vehicles and other applications beyond Oxford City Centre.</p>
