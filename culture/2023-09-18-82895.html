<p>Breaking News: 2019-2020</p>
<p>Covid-19 Pandemic: India records over 45,000 new cases in a single day for the first time, highest since May 2021. The country has reported over 367 million confirmed COVID-19 infections and over 48,000 deaths due to the virus so far.</p>
<p>India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget 2021 in Parliament today. The budget focused on boosting the economy by investing in infrastructure, healthcare, education, and rural development. It also included measures such as tax relief for middle-class taxpayers, increase in old age pension, and expansion of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) to provide food grains to more people at affordable prices.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its global growth forecast for 2021 down from 6% to 5.2%. The IMF cited the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions as major factors affecting global economic growth.</p>
<p>India's government has approved a new policy that allows foreign companies to operate in the country without seeking local partner or investing in the local economy, in a move that could attract more FDI into the country. The policy will allow non-resident Indians (NRIs) and other individuals who hold valid passports to establish and manage their own businesses in India.</p>
<p>The government has also announced a new scheme to provide financial assistance of up to Rs 5 lakh each to over 2 crore beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U). The scheme will help urban poor households living in slum areas and those living in rented homes to own their own houses.</p>
<p>The Indian government has launched a new scheme called PM Gati Shakti - National Master Plan for Infrastructure Development, aimed at improving the efficiency of infrastructure development and management across the country. The scheme aims to connect all districts with high-speed highways, railways, and air travel by 2030.</p>
