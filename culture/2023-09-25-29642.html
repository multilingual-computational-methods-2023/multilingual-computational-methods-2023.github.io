<p>A new study has found that the number of people who have died from COVID-19 in the United States has reached 120,000. This is according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The report also revealed that over 35 million Americans have been infected with the virus so far.</p>
<p>The study was conducted by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and is updated daily. It provides a more accurate picture of the pandemic's impact on the US population.</p>
<p>According to the report, the states with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths are New York, California, and Texas. The report also highlights that the virus has disproportionately affected minority communities in several cities across the country.</p>
<p>The study suggests that social distancing measures and widespread testing could help slow the spread of the virus and save lives. It is important to note that the number of cases and deaths may continue to rise as more data becomes available.</p>
