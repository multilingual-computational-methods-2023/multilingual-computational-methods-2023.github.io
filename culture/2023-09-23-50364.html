<p>A new study has found that a popular type of plastic used in food packaging may be harmful to the environment. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, suggests that polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and containers may contribute to ocean pollution and harm marine life.</p>
<p>The study focused on microplastics, which are small pieces of plastic less than five millimeters in size that can be ingested by marine animals. The researchers found that the type of plastic commonly used for food packaging, PET, was one of the most common types of microplastic pollution in the ocean.</p>
<p>"We were surprised to find such a high concentration of microplastics in the ocean," said study co-author Kelly Swanson, an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley. "It's clear that our plastic waste is having a major impact on the environment."</p>
<p>The researchers suggest that the high levels of microplastics in the ocean may be due to the fact that many plastics are not properly disposed of or recycled. Instead, they end up in landfills or the environment where they can break down into smaller pieces. These microplastics then make their way into the food chain and eventually end up in our stomachs as marine animals consume them.</p>
<p>The study is significant because it highlights the need for more sustainable alternatives to single-use plastics, such as biodegradable materials like paper or plant-based packaging. The researchers also suggest that consumers reduce their use of plastic by choosing reusable containers and bags instead of disposable ones.</p>
