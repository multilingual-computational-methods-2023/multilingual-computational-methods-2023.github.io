<p>A new study suggests that the use of social media may have negative effects on mental health. The study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, found that social media users who report feeling more anxious or depressed are more likely to experience those feelings after scrolling through their feeds for a few hours.</p>
<p>The study is based on data from nearly 3000 people aged 18-25 who participated in an online survey. Participants were asked about their use of social media, including the frequency and duration of their posts and comments, as well as any negative effects they experienced due to social media use.</p>
<p>Researchers found that those who reported feeling more anxious or depressed after scrolling through their feeds for a few hours were more likely to experience these feelings again in the future. The study suggests that social media may have negative effects on mental health and that individuals should be mindful of their social media use.</p>
