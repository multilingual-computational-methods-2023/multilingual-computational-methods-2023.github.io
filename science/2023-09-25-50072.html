<p>A new study has found that the use of social media can have negative effects on mental health. The study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, suggests that social media may contribute to depression, anxiety and other mood disorders.</p>
<p>The study is based on a survey of over 90,000 people aged 18-25 years old in nine countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The participants were asked about their social media use, including how often they used Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and other platforms.</p>
<p>The study found that people who spent more time on social media had a higher risk of experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders. The researchers also found that the type of social media platform used (e.g., photo or video-sharing versus messaging) did not significantly affect mental health outcomes.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that social media use should be approached with caution and that individuals may benefit from limiting their time on these platforms or seeking support if they are struggling with their mental health.</p>
