<p>The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has released its latest monetary policy statement, which includes an interest rate decision. Here are the key takeaways from the statement:</p>
<p>Interest rates remain unchanged at 6.75% for both the repurchase and deposit rates. The SARB said that the current economic conditions suggest a neutral stance on monetary policy.</p>
<p>The SARB also announced that it will continue with its quantitative easing (QE) measures, which include purchasing R120 billion of government bonds over the next six months. This is in an effort to stimulate domestic demand and support inflation.</p>
<p>In addition, the SARB said that it will continue to monitor developments in global financial markets and assess the impact of these on domestic economic conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, the statement suggests that the SARB remains committed to supporting the South African economy while keeping a close eye on global trends.</p>
