            <p>2019-2020 flu season is shaping up to be one of the worst in years, with cases on the rise in many parts of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has now declared a global health emergency due to the severity and spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is an infectious disease caused by a virus that infects the respiratory system. It spreads from person to person through coughing or sneezing. The symptoms include fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, headache, dry cough, and sore throat. In severe cases, it can lead to complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and even death.</p>
<p>The flu season typically starts in the fall and peaks in the winter months. However, this year's season has been particularly intense due to the emergence of a new strain of the virus that is more likely to cause serious illness than previous strains. The strain, known as H1N1, was first identified in 2009 during the swine flu pandemic and has since evolved into multiple strains that are now circulating globally.</p>
<p>The WHO is urging people to take precautions such as getting vaccinated against the flu, washing hands regularly, wearing masks, and avoiding large gatherings to help prevent the spread of the virus. It also recommends staying home if you feel sick or have symptoms of the flu.</p>
