<p>New York City has a new leader. After serving as the city's public advocate for two terms, Eric Adams was elected mayor on Tuesday, making him the second African American to hold the position in the city's history.</p>
<p>Adams, 59, defeated Republican candidate Marcos Rodriguez and independent candidate Maya Wiley in the November election. He will take office on January 1, succeeding Bill de Blasio, who did not seek reelection after serving two terms as mayor.</p>
<p>"I am humbled by the trust that the people of New York City have placed in me," Adams said in a statement Tuesday night. "Together, we can create an inclusive and resilient city that works for everyone, not just the wealthy few."</p>
<p>Adams has been a vocal advocate for criminal justice reform, affordable housing, and police accountability during his time as public advocate. He also previously served as Brooklyn borough president and New York City Council member.</p>
<p>As mayor, Adams will be responsible for overseeing all city agencies and departments, implementing policies, and representing the city in national and international forums.</p>
