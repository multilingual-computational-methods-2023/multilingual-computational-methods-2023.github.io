<p>Review: The Last Five Years at the Charing Cross Theatre</p>
<p>Published on November 27, 2019 by LizLeave a comment</p>
<p>The Last Five Years is a musical that tells the story of a relationship from both sides. It begins with one character’s perspective, then switches to the other character’s perspective as they experience their life together and apart over five years. The production at the Charing Cross Theatre is directed by Polly Findlay and features music and lyrics by Jason Robert Brown.</p>
<p>The Last Five Years tells a story of love, loss and moving on. It follows the relationship between Jamie (played by Joe Melia) and Cathy (played by Georgia Mancuso), who fall in love when they’re both at different stages in their lives – he is an aspiring writer, she has just graduated from college. As they spend more time together, they face challenges and obstacles that test their relationship. The musical explores the ups and downs of falling in love, as well as the emotional impact of losing someone you care about deeply.</p>
<p>The production features a talented cast who deliver the songs with emotion and raw power. Joe Melia’s performance as Jamie is particularly strong, delivering his lyrics with vulnerability and heartbreak. Georgia Mancuso’s Cathy is also impressive, conveying a range of emotions from joy to sadness throughout their relationship. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable on stage, adding to the emotional impact of the story.</p>
<p>The set design is simple but effective, with a few pieces of furniture and props that are used creatively to change locations and reflect the characters’ feelings. The lighting design also plays an important role in setting the mood and tone for each scene.</p>
<p>Overall, The Last Five Years is a powerful and moving musical that explores the complexities of love and loss. It tells a story that many people can relate to, and the performances from the cast make it a must-see production. 4/5 stars.</p>
<p>The Last Five Years is on at the Charing Cross Theatre until 29th December 2019. For more information and tickets, visit the theatre’s website here.</p>
