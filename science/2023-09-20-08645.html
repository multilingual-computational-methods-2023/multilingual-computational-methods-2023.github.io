<p>Brazil's former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been released from prison after serving a six-year sentence for corruption. He was convicted of accepting bribes in exchange for government contracts while he was the country's labor minister and then president. The Supreme Court ordered his release on Friday, saying that he had completed his sentence and met all other legal requirements. Lula, as he is known, has been a key figure in Brazil's political landscape since leaving office in 2011. He has vowed to run for president again in the upcoming elections.</p>
