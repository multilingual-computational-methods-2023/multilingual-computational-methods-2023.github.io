            <p>2019-2020 flu season is shaping up to be one of the worst in years, with many states reporting high levels of flu activity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that flu rates are at least twice as high as usual this year, and some areas have reported hospitalizations and deaths from the flu.</p>
<p>The agency recommends getting a flu shot to protect against the virus, but it's not too late to get one yet. The vaccine is typically most effective in the first few months after it's been distributed, so now is a good time to get vaccinated if you haven't already done so.</p>
