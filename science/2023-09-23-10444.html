<p>The US Department of Justice has announced that it will not appeal the decision to dismiss charges against former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. This means that Flynn can avoid prison time and may be able to avoid a special counsel investigation into his activities. The DOJ's move comes after a federal judge in Washington, DC, ruled last week that there was no evidence to support the charge of lying to FBI agents about his conversations with Russian officials during the 2016 election.</p>
