<p>BREAKING NEWS: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced a new plan to combat the city's rising homelessness crisis. The plan includes investing $8 billion in affordable housing, job training and mental health services for those experiencing homelessness.</p>
<p>The plan will also create 9,000 new shelter beds and expand outreach programs to connect people with resources they need to get off the streets.</p>
<p>"We have a moral obligation to ensure that everyone has a safe and stable place to call home," de Blasio said in a statement. "This comprehensive approach will help us take significant steps towards ending homelessness in our city."</p>
<p>The plan comes as the number of people experiencing homelessness in New York City has increased by 40% since 2013, with many individuals and families struggling to find stable housing due to rising rents, evictions, and a lack of affordable options.</p>
