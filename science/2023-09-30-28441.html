<p>The 34th G7 summit is taking place in France this weekend, with leaders from the world's seven largest economies gathering to discuss global issues. The summit comes as the US and China are at odds over trade policy and other issues. French President Emmanuel Macron has called for a "true" globalization that benefits everyone, but some experts say the group is out of step with the times. The summit is also taking place against the backdrop of ongoing protests in France over economic inequality and police brutality.</p>
