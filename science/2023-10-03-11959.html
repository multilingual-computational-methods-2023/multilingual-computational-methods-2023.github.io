<p>The following is a breaking news story from our sister publication, The Hindu.</p>
<p>India has emerged as the second largest exporter of pharmaceuticals in the world after the United States, with exports worth $26 billion last fiscal year, according to industry data.</p>
<p>In a report released by the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), the country’s pharmaceutical sector grew by 17% during the period from April 2018 to March 2019, driven by an increase in domestic demand and exports.</p>
<p>The IPA is an association of leading multinational companies operating in India. The report said that the Indian pharmaceutical industry has been witnessing a steady growth trajectory over the past few years, with the sector registering a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% during the period from April 2014 to March 2019.</p>
<p>The top export destinations for Indian pharmaceuticals were the United States, the European Union, Japan and South Korea. The report said that the US was the largest market for Indian pharmaceutical companies with a share of 35%, followed by the EU at 27%.</p>
<p>India’s pharmaceutical industry has been driven by factors such as an aging population, increasing health awareness among people, and advancements in medical technology, the IPA said. The report added that the sector is expected to continue growing steadily in the coming years due to rising demand for healthcare services and new product launches.</p>
