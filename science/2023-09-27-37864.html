<p>Astronomers have discovered a new exoplanet that is located about 100 light years away from Earth, and it has an atmosphere that contains water vapor. This discovery could potentially lead to the development of more accurate ways to measure the properties of other planets in our galaxy.</p>
<p>The planet, named TOI-700 d, was discovered by a high school student intern at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The discovery was announced today by NASA and the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"This is an exciting time for astronomy," said Sarah Seiffert, a research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center who worked on the discovery. "We are now able to study planets outside our solar system in unprecedented detail, and this newfound knowledge will help us better understand how planets form and evolve."</p>
<p>TOI-700 d is an Earth-sized planet that orbits a star called TOI-700, which is located about 100 light years away from Earth. The planet has an atmosphere that contains water vapor, according to the researchers who made the discovery. This discovery could potentially lead to more accurate ways to measure the properties of other planets in our galaxy.</p>
<p>The planet was discovered by a high school student intern at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who worked with scientists from the University of California, Santa Cruz and other institutions. The researchers published their findings today in the journal Nature Astronomy.</p>
<p>"This is an incredible achievement for both the student and the scientific community," said John Grunsky, a research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center who was also involved in the discovery. "It demonstrates that even high school students can make important contributions to our understanding of the universe."</p>
