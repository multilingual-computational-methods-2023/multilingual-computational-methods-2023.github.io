<p>BREAKING NEWS: The European Union has launched an investigation into the use of pesticides in agriculture.</p>
<p>The move comes after years of pressure from environmental groups and farmers who have raised concerns about the impact of pesticides on human health and the environment.</p>
<p>The investigation will look at the impact of neonicotinoids, a class of insecticides that are widely used in agriculture but have been linked to bee deaths and other harmful effects. The EU has already banned certain uses of neonicotinoids, but campaigners say more needs to be done to protect wildlife and human health.</p>
<p>The investigation will look at the impact of neonicotinoids on bees, other pollinators, and farmland birds. It will also examine the risks associated with the use of other pesticides in agriculture. The European Commission has said it will take action if the investigation reveals evidence of harm to the environment or human health.</p>
<p>The move comes after years of pressure from environmental groups and farmers who have raised concerns about the impact of pesticides on human health and the environment. In 2013, Friends of the Earth launched a campaign calling for an EU-wide ban on neonicotinoids, which has since grown into a wider movement against the use of pesticides in agriculture.</p>
<p>The investigation is expected to take several months and will involve researchers from various scientific institutions across Europe. The results of the investigation are likely to be published later this year.</p>
