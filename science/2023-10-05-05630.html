            <p>100,000-strong march in London against Trump's visit</p>
<p>By Press Association Share</p>
<p>By Associated Press Reporter</p>
<p>Around 100,000 people have taken to the streets of central London to protest against US President Donald Trump's upcoming state visit.</p>
<p>The demonstration was estimated by police and organisers to be one of the largest in recent years, with a diverse crowd chanting "No Trump, no KKK, no fascist UK" as they walked through the city.</p>
<p>Protesters held banners reading "Dump Trump" and "Impeach Trump", while some carried signs calling for a boycott of the Trump International Hotel in London.</p>
<p>The protest was sparked by Mr Trump's decision to cancel a planned visit to Manchester, where he had been due to hold a rally on June 1st.</p>
<p>The move followed protests against him during his previous visits to the UK, including a mass demonstration outside Buckingham Palace that drew hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
