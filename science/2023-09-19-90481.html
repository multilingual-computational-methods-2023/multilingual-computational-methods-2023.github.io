<p>By Staff Reporter Oct 7, 2019 | 3 minutes read</p>
<p>The National Assembly has announced that the 2019-2020 budget will be presented on Monday, October 8. The budget is expected to outline the government's plans for the next financial year and will include details of its spending plans, revenue projections and any other relevant information.

<p>The presentation of the budget is an important event in the country's fiscal calendar as it sets the tone for the government's policies and spending plans for the coming year. The budget will be closely watched by investors, businesses and individuals who are interested in understanding how the government plans to spend their money over the next financial year.</p>
<p>It is expected that the budget will include details of the government's plans for infrastructure development, education, healthcare, social welfare, and other areas of public spending. The budget will also outline any tax measures that the government plans to introduce to generate revenue to fund its spending plans.</p>
<p>The government has already announced some key initiatives such as the implementation of a new national health insurance scheme, the construction of roads and bridges, and the recruitment of more teachers and healthcare workers. These initiatives are expected to be further detailed in the upcoming budget presentation.</p>
<p>It is important for investors, businesses and individuals to keep an eye on the 2019-2020 budget as it will provide valuable insights into the government's plans for the economy and how they plan to allocate resources in the coming year.</p>
