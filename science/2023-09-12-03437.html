<p>By: Tribune Media Wire</p>
<p>A 10-year-old girl in Ohio saved her entire family from a house fire by using the "flashlight" trick, according to reports.</p>
<p>The Columbus Dispatch reported that the girl's father was home with their three children when he noticed smoke coming from the kitchen. The family called 911 and tried to evacuate but found themselves trapped in the house due to a locked door.</p>
<p>According to the report, the girl used her dad's phone flashlight to signal for help. She shone the light through a window and saw firefighters responding to the scene. They were able to break down the door and rescue the family.</p>
