<p>The 2018/19 season was a remarkable one for the English Premier League, with some of the most exciting and memorable moments in recent years. Here are some of the top stories from the campaign that captured the attention of football fans around the world.</p>
<p>1. Manchester City’s dominance</p>
<p>Manchester City won their fourth Premier League title in five seasons, finishing 20 points clear of Liverpool. Their impressive record of 98 points was the highest ever recorded in a single season in English football history.</p>
<p>2. Manchester United’s revival</p>
<p>After years of decline under previous managers, Ole Gunnar Solskjær led Manchester United to an impressive top four finish and a spot in the Europa League final. The club’s supporters were thrilled with their team’s performances and showed it by chanting “Ole, Ole, Ole” at every game.</p>
<p>3. Liverpool’s title challenge</p>
<p>Liverpool’s title challenge was one of the most exciting stories of the season. They went into the campaign as underdogs but put up a strong fight against Manchester City, with star players like Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk leading the way. However, their 98 points were not enough to catch the champions.</p>
<p>4. Tottenham’s late push</p>
<p>Tottenham had a remarkable season, finishing just two points behind league leaders Liverpool. They also reached the Champions League final, but lost to Barcelona on away goals. Their performances under manager Mauricio Pochettino were praised by fans and critics alike.</p>
<p>5. Cardiff City’s relegation</p>
<p>Cardiff City became the first team to be relegated from the Premier League since 2013 when they were mathematically relegated at the end of the season. The club had a dismal campaign, winning just five games all year and scoring only 46 goals in their 38 matches.</p>
