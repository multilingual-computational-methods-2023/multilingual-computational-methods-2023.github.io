<p>A new study has found that exposure to air pollution can increase the risk of developing heart disease by up to 8.5%. The research, conducted by King's College London and published in the European Heart Journal, suggests that air pollution is a significant environmental factor that contributes to heart disease. The study also highlights that the effects of air pollution on heart health are particularly pronounced among people with existing cardiovascular conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. The researchers warn that reducing exposure to air pollution could help prevent and manage heart disease, and call for further research into the impact of air pollution on the heart.</p>
