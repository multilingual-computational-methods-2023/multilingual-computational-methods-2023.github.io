<p>BREAKING NEWS: New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern announces new gun control measures after Christchurch mosque shootings</p>
<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced a package of gun control measures in response to the Christchurch mosque shootings that killed 51 people. The government will ban all military-style semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles within weeks, Ardern said at a news conference on Wednesday. In addition, she said the government would establish an independent firearms buyback scheme to buy back guns from law-abiding citizens who already own them. The government will also introduce new regulations for licensed firearms owners, including mandatory background checks before buying a gun and limiting the number of guns an individual can own. Ardern said the measures were in response to the Christchurch shootings and would help prevent future acts of violence.</p>
