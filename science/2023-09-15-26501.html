<p>Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, July 16, 2019 – The Department of Health and Medical Services (DoHMS) has announced the launch of a new mobile application that provides patients with easy access to their medical records. The app is available for download on both iOS and Android devices.</p>
<p>The new app will enable patients to view their medical history, including appointments, diagnoses, medications, and test results, as well as request appointments with healthcare professionals and update personal information. It also includes a feature that allows patients to share their medical records with other authorized parties, such as family members or insurance providers.</p>
<p>DoHMS has worked closely with the Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (SEHA) to develop the app, which is designed to improve patient care by providing them with greater visibility and control over their health information. The app also aims to reduce administrative burden on healthcare professionals by streamlining the sharing of medical records between different healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Dr. Noura Al Kaabi, Acting Undersecretary at DoHMS, said: “The launch of this mobile application is a significant step forward in our efforts to improve patient care and convenience. It provides patients with easy access to their medical records, which can help them better understand their health status and take an active role in managing their conditions.”</p>
<p>Dr. Fahad Al Marzouqi, Director of Medical Information at SEHA, added: “This app is a key component of our digital transformation strategy, which aims to improve patient outcomes by providing access to high-quality healthcare services anytime and anywhere. We are committed to continuously improving the quality and availability of medical records for patients across Abu Dhabi.”</p>
<p>The new mobile application joins other initiatives launched by DoHMS and SEHA, such as the MySEHA app, which provides patients with a single point of access to their health information and allows them to schedule appointments with healthcare professionals. The two apps are part of the wider digital transformation strategy adopted by the Abu Dhabi government to improve patient care and reduce costs.</p>
