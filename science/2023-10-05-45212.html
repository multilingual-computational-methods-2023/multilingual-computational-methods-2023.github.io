            <p>19th-century-style, the UK government has announced that it will be investing in a new fleet of electric buses to replace its existing diesel ones. The move is part of the government's commitment to reducing air pollution and improving public health.</p>
<p>The new electric buses are expected to be more efficient, cost less to run, and produce fewer emissions than their diesel counterparts. They will also have advanced technology that allows them to communicate with each other and with traffic management systems, which could help to improve road safety and reduce congestion.</p>
<p>This is great news for those who care about the environment and public health, but it's not enough on its own. We need to see a much larger shift towards electric transportation if we want to tackle climate change and create a more sustainable future.</p>
