<p>Breaking News: New York City Declares Public Health Emergency Over Measles Outbreak</p>
<p>New York City has declared a public health emergency due to the ongoing measles outbreak in the city. The declaration was made by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday, July 9th, 2019. This comes after the number of confirmed cases reached 346 this week, with most of them being linked to an Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>The emergency order will allow health officials to take additional measures to contain the outbreak, including implementing mandatory vaccination requirements for students attending public schools and daycare centers. The city is also considering a temporary ban on unvaccinated minors from visiting some religious institutions.</p>
<p>This is not the first time New York City has declared a measles emergency. In 2018, there was a large outbreak in Rockland County, which led to a similar declaration.</p>
