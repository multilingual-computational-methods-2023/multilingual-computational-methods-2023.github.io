<p>A new study has found that the average person in the UK will spend over three years of their life waiting for traffic signals. The research, conducted by the RAC Foundation, also revealed that the length of time people wait at red lights is increasing due to roadworks and maintenance work on infrastructure. In fact, 10% of all traffic delays in the UK are caused by roadworks, with rush hour traffic being particularly affected. The study suggests that this is having a significant impact on people's daily lives, with many experiencing delays of over an hour at peak times. Read more about the findings here.</p>
