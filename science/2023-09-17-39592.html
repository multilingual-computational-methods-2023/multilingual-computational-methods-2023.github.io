<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its guidance on the use of masks, including cloth face coverings. The new guidelines recommend that people wear cloth face coverings in public indoor settings, such as stores, restaurants, and other businesses, regardless of whether or not they are vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>
<p>The CDC also recommends that people who have a weakened immune system, such as from cancer treatment or HIV/AIDS, should wear masks indoors in public places to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, the agency suggests that people who live with someone who is immunocompromised or has an underlying health condition should consider wearing masks in indoor public spaces.</p>
<p>The updated guidance follows recent increases in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations across the United States due to the emergence of the Delta variant of the virus. The CDC recommends that fully vaccinated people still wear masks indoors in public settings, but they do not need to wear them outdoors or when engaged in outdoor activities.</p>
