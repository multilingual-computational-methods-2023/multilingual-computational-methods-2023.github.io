            <p>10-year-old girl becomes youngest person to fly solo around the world</p>
<p>The 10-year-old girl, who has not been identified, became the youngest person to fly solo around the world when she completed her journey on Monday. She flew a Yakovlev aircraft with registration number G-IVEC and was accompanied by her father, who served as her co-pilot.</p>
<p>The girl's achievement is even more remarkable given that she had only 10 days of training before embarking on the journey. The youngster completed the flight from New York to Muscat in Oman in just over four days, covering a distance of around 23,500 miles.</p>
<p>The girl's father, who is also an experienced pilot, told reporters that his daughter had been inspired by the story of another girl, Lily Jester, who became the youngest person to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1987 at the age of 16. The youngster's journey was sponsored by the World Record Attempts Foundation and she received support from various organizations, including the Royal Air Force.</p>
<p>The girl's achievement has made her an inspiration to many people around the world, especially girls who aspire to fly. She is expected to return home soon after completing her journey.</p>
