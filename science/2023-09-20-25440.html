            <p>2019-2020 budget proposal includes $3.5 billion for border wall construction</p>
<p>The 2019-2020 federal budget proposal, released by the Trump administration on Monday, includes $3.5 billion for the construction of a physical barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to The Washington Post . This is in addition to the $800 million that was allocated last year for the construction of barriers and fencing along the same border. The proposal also includes funding for other immigration enforcement measures, such as hiring more Border Patrol agents and improving technology at the border.</p>
