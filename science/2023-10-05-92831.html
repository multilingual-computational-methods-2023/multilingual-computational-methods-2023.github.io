            <p>2019-2020 flu season has started</p>
<p>By Dr. Don Williamson, MD, FACEP | January 8, 2020</p>
<p>The 2019-2020 flu season has already begun in some parts of the world and is expected to continue into February or March. The flu season typically starts earlier than the summer months because people spend more time indoors and are exposed to respiratory droplets that can spread the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends getting a flu vaccine every year as it becomes available. This helps protect against the flu and reduces the risk of developing complications such as pneumonia, hospitalization, or death.</p>
