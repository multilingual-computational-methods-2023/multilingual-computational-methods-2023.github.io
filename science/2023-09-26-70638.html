<p>A new study by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has found that a common medication used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease can also help prevent cognitive decline in older adults. The drug is called losartan, which belongs to a class of medications known as angiotensin II receptor antagonists.</p>
<p>The study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, involved 186 older adults who were free from dementia at the time of enrollment. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either losartan or a placebo for an average of four years. The researchers found that those who received losartan had a lower risk of developing cognitive decline compared to those who received a placebo.</p>
<p>The study is significant because it suggests that taking losartan may help prevent brain damage caused by high blood pressure and other chronic conditions, said senior author Dr. Michael Mina, an associate professor of medicine at UCLA. “This is a big deal,” he added. “It’s the first randomized trial to show a cognitive benefit with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist like losartan.”</p>
<p>The researchers hope that their findings will lead to further studies on the use of losartan to prevent cognitive decline, as well as other potential benefits for older adults. They also cautioned that more research is needed to determine whether the drug’s effects are due to its active ingredient or other compounds in the medication.</p>
