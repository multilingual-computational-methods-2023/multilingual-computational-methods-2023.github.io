<p>Breaking News: The UK has voted to leave the European Union.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom has officially left the European Union, following a referendum in which over 51% of people voted to leave. The vote was confirmed by British Prime Minister Theresa May, who said that the country would now begin the process of negotiating its departure from the EU. The UK will remain part of the union until at least two years after the official exit negotiations have been completed.</p>
<p>The news has sent shockwaves through the political and economic landscape of Europe, with many leaders expressing concern about the potential impact on trade and investment between the UK and other member states. The stock markets have also experienced significant fluctuations in response to the news, with investors closely watching for any signs of how the negotiations will unfold.</p>
<p>The UK's departure from the EU is expected to be a complex process that will involve discussions on issues such as trade agreements, immigration policies, and the future relationship between London and Brussels. The country has already set a deadline of October 31st, 2019 for its official exit from the union.</p>
