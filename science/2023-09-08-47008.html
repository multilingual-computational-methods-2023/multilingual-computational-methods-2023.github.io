            <p>10.2 million people in the US have now received a COVID-19 vaccine</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that as of Saturday, about 10.2 million people in the United States have received at least one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna coronavirus vaccine. The agency also reported that more than 36.4 million doses of the vaccines have been distributed across the country so far.</p>
<p>The number of shots given out is still much lower than the total number of people in the US, which is around 328 million. But with more than half of all Americans now having received at least one dose, it's an important milestone in the fight against COVID-19.</p>
<p>"This progress is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our public health officials, healthcare workers, and communities across the country," said CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield in a statement. "We must continue to work together to increase vaccine access and ensure that every person has an opportunity to get vaccinated."</p>
