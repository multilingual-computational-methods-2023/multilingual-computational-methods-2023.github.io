            <p>2019-2020 season cancelled due to COVID-19</p>

<p>The 2019-2020 Broadway season has been cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The decision was made by the Broadway League and the American Theatre Wing, which oversee the annual Tony Awards ceremony.</p>
<p>"After careful consideration, the Broadway League and the American Theatre Wing have decided to cancel the 74th Annual Tony Awards," the organizations said in a statement Tuesday. "The health and safety of our cast members, audiences, and staff remain our top priority."</p>
<p>The Tony Awards had been scheduled to take place on June 7, but with theaters closed across the country due to the virus outbreak, it made sense to cancel the event for the season. The organizations said they will continue to work with Broadway's producers and theater owners to find ways to celebrate the industry in the future.</p>
<p>"We are devastated by the impact of COVID-19 on our industry and want to thank all the artists, producers, and theaters who have been working tirelessly to bring live performances back to audiences," they said. "As we navigate these uncertain times, we will continue to work with our colleagues in the theater community to find creative ways to honor the best of Broadway."</p>
<p>The Tony Awards are a major event for the Broadway industry, drawing top talent from across the country to celebrate the best shows and performances of the season. The awards show has been held annually since 1947 and is considered one of the most prestigious honors in theater.</p>
